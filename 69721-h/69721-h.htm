<small>THE CONQUEROR</small></h3>
</div>


<p>The sun was setting over the Narmáda plain. In
the midst of long stretches of sunburnt farm land
the waters of the great river rolled and flashed with
light. The barren millet-fields were illumined with
long streaks of yellow sunshine that ran to the base of
Mandu, an immense plateau, rising sheer from the lowlands
to a height of some three or four hundred feet.
Between it and the nearest of the Vindhyas is a deep
chasm, a quarter of a mile or more in width, bridged
over by a miracle of man, a stone causeway, many
centuries old even on the day of September 6, in the
year of the Christian Lord 1205, and of the Hejira
601.</p>

<p>This causeway, a vast, stone bridge, supported on
piers built up from the rocks below, balustraded to
a height of five feet, and finished on each corner by
watch-towers in which lookouts were always stationed,
made the single approach to the otherwise impregnable
plateau which formed in itself the entire principality of
Mandu. Remarkable among Indian ruins to-day are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
those that crown the deserted height of this unique
spot: temples, houses, and vast palaces of the most
ancient times; and at the period of which we speak,
the opening years of the thirteenth century, Mandu was
in the heyday of its Indian glory, renowned throughout
the West for its wealth, its power, and the righteousness
of its rulers.</p>

<p>The rice harvest was just beginning, and the inhabitants
of Mandu—Brahman, Vaisya, Sudra, and Pariah
alike—were busily engaged in this toil of peace. The
Kshatriyas, or warrior part of the population, were not
in the minds of their fellows to-day; for at the end of
the rains they had marched to the north on an expedition
against an army of Mohammedans by whom their
neighbors of Dhár were beset.</p>

<p>The great causeway was deserted save for its lookouts
and a fakir who had chosen to light a harvest
Ishti on the stones near the southwest tower. As the
sun neared the horizon, however, the silence was broken
by a sudden screaming of birds and monkeys in the
wooded mountain gorge beyond the bridge. Two of
the guards stretched themselves and looked out along
the pass—looked, and were transfixed. Shrill trumpet-notes
and the faint beating of hoofs along a rocky road
became suddenly audible. The glint of spear-heads
shone among the trees. Lastly came the tapping of the
tiny saddle-drums. Two of the soldiers shouted together:
“Avalu! They are coming!” and, leaping
down to the bridge, started at breakneck pace toward
the fields, crying as they ran: “The army! The soldiers!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Lord Rajah! They are here! They have
returned!”</p>

<p>The other two guards made no move to leave their
advantageous posts. The Brahman, also, abandoning
his invocation to Agni, mounted the nearest tower, to
watch the arrival of his earthly ruler. He had scarcely
taken up his position when the vanguard of returning
warriors rode out upon the bridge, a glittering company,
headed by the stateliest of figures, at whose
approach the guards all but knelt in salute to their
ruler, Rai-Khizar-Pál, Rajah of Mandu in the country
of Malwa, a brave and noble king. Slightly behind
him rode two other richly dressed men, mounted on
beautiful horses, each of whom came in for some share
of the acknowledgments of the guards,—Puran, captain
of the troops, and Ragunáth, confidential adviser
of the Rajah. Slowly, for the horses were fagged with
long marching, the three passed over the bridge, followed
by a lengthening train of officers and men, horse
and foot, over whose robes of crimson and white and
green played the last beams of the setting sun, sending
off a dazzle of light from the rubies that fastened a long
spray of white feathers to the turban of the Rajah.</p>

<p>By the time the first of the cavalcade had entered the
broad road leading straight across the plateau to the
palaces at its eastern end, throngs of field-workers and
people of the town had begun to line the edges of the
route; for the news of the army’s return had spread
from one end of the plateau to the other, and men and
women left their work and, stained and disordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
with toil, rushed to the road to greet their ruler
and their defenders. A well-built lot of people they
were, by far the greater number of the men invested
with the cord of the twice-born. And their king’s
popularity was very evident from the welcome they
were giving him. Men of the Brahman caste lifted their
hands to him, Vaisyas fell upon their knees, and Sudras
and Pariahs prostrated themselves upon the earth till
he had passed. Then all stood gazing eagerly at the
slow-moving file of troops. Jests, salutations, and
words of welcome passed between the onlookers and
the returning warriors; and the general spirit of joy
was redoubled when it was found that the campaign,
short as it had been, was also a victorious one. Evidences
of victory presently became visible; for, at the
end of the lines of foot-soldiers, came a long string of
captives, many on foot, a few mounted upon mules,
these last with their feet bound together by thongs
passed round the animals, their arms tied behind them
with ropes of hide, and the beasts themselves fastened
together in a long chain. Beside this mounted company,
who represented captives of station, rode a soldier
armed with a triple-lashed whip, which he used with
no great degree of compassion upon the backs of his
charges.</p>

<p>These captives were greeted by the onlookers with
shouts of triumph, but with no insults or even unfriendly
remarks. The followers of the Prophet were
still rather mythical enemies to these dwellers of the
Dekhan. Mahmoud of Ghazni was a name they recognized;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
but Aybek, the great slave, who had just
mounted the throne of Delhi, was as unreal to them as
their own kings who had died three thousand years ago,
in the first conquest of India. These captives now
among them were tangible enough, but they presented
too abject an appearance to give any idea of their force
in battle. The chagrin of captivity, the many days of
riding and walking, the intolerable suffering occasioned
by their bonds, had broken the spirit of all save one,
who rode at the head of the pitiable procession. He
was young, this man, good to look on even in his
unkempt state, and his clothes, through the stains of
war and woe, showed their richness. He sat straight
on his unsaddled mule, and his head was not bent
down. He seemed to notice nothing of what passed
around him, but kept his eyes fixed far ahead on the
long, curving range of blackened mountains, lighted by
the glow of the sunset sky that blazed behind them.
His dignity and his unconsciousness made him a continual
object of interest to the crowd, and the slave-master
was under a running fire of questions which he
was not slow to answer.</p>

<p>“He is a prince, a son of the enemy’s leader. He
will bring a great ransom,” he repeated again and
again, proudly.</p>

<p>Cheers never failed to follow the explanation; and,
after some twenty minutes of this trial, the Arab’s
head for the first time drooped, and a deep sigh broke
from him.</p>

<p>“Let not my lord grieve,” whispered the person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
riding next behind him, a boy, scarcely more than
fifteen years in age. “My lord will be ransomed.”</p>

<p>But the Mohammedan sighed again, making no
answer; and the slave-master, overhearing the whisper,
cut off the conversation with a quick stroke of his whip
on the back of the boy, who bore it, as he bore all
things for his Prince, without a sound.</p>

<p>By this time the road, which had hitherto run
through grain-fields, approached a building set, as was
the custom with many Indian temples and palaces, in
the midst of a square pool of water. The structure was
built of white stone, in the usual massive and grotesque
Indian style, and seemed only approachable by a narrow
path between two glassy sheets of water, which reflected
in their mirror-depths the clumps of wild cotton
trees, graceful bamboos, and feathery tamarinds by
which they were surrounded. The eyes of the captives,
turned from this structure only when it lay
behind them, were instantly fixed upon another, infinitely
greater, which a new bend in the road disclosed a
few hundred yards beyond. The entrance to this new
building was filled with a bustling throng, for here the
soldiers were dismounting. It was the dwelling of the
rulers of Mandu; and in five minutes more the captives
themselves had halted in the huge, unpaved
courtyard round which the palace was built.</p>

<p>The sun had now set and the brief twilight sunk
into darkness. A bonfire burned already in the centre
of the courtyard, and its fitful, wavering light accentuated
the activity of the scene. The Rajah and a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
of the officials had disappeared into the palace; but it
seemed as if all the rest of the little army, together
with a hundred attendants, were crowded into the
courtyard:—soldiers, slaves, eunuchs, page-boys, villagers,
and women,—women unveiled, unabashed,
openly interested in their fellow-creatures. Finally, in
the portal of the north wing, quiet, calm, betraying
no sign of weariness, stood Ragunáth, the right hand
of the Rajah, that small, slender, well-favored man,
with the eyes of the lynx, an intellect keen as a steel
blade, and a constitution that was superior to time
and disease. He was still clad in his crimson riding-costume.
The turban had not been lifted from his
head; but he carried in his hand a thin, ebony staff.
He was engaged in directing the dismount and disposal
of the captives. Already those that had come on foot
had been led away by guards into the south wing; and
now, under his low-voiced commands, two men were
lifting the riders from their mules and, as soon as they
could stand, sending them after the others. One of
these, only, made any resistance to this plan. He was
the boy who had ridden second in the line, behind his
leader. Spent as he was, this child struggled violently
against separation from his master, at whose commands
only he finally consented to be led away. And now
this master remained alone, upon his mule, his face
turned to Ragunáth, and in his eyes the faintest expression
of dislike.</p>

<p>“What is thy name, captive?” demanded the Indian,
in a flat, low tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“Fidá Ibn-Mahmud Ibn-Hassan el-Asra,” returned
the captive.</p>

<p>“The son of the Mohammedan leader?”</p>

<p>“His brother’s son.”</p>

<p>“Ah! then you are not a prince?”</p>

<p>“I am the head of our race. My father is dead.”</p>

<p>“Ah!—Partha, let him be taken down and brought
to my apartment. Then go tell the Lord Rajah that
the work is done.” And, turning upon his heel, the
minister disappeared into the corridor behind him.</p>

<p>Immediately the two men beside him cut the thongs
that bound Fidá’s feet to the mule; and they also
unfastened his arms. He was lifted from the animal,
and set upon his feet, at the same time supported on
either side. It was some moments before his numb
and stiffened limbs would bear him; but at length he
straightened, and followed his guides into the palace.
They proceeded for some distance down a hall hung
at regular distances with finely wrought lamps, and at
length turned into a narrower passage that ended, Fidá
could see, in another courtyard. Before this was
reached, however, they halted at a doorway closed by a
hanging; and here Fidá was bidden to enter and pass
through into the farthest room. Then he was left
alone.</p>

<p>The captive gave a sigh of relief. After the long
strain, just ended, silence and semi-darkness seemed to
him unspeakable boons. He longed to lie down here
upon the ground and sleep. That being impossible,
however, he took the only practicable advantage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
respite. Facing toward what he believed to be the
west,—and Mecca,—he threw himself into the devout
attitude and repeated the sunset prayers. Then, relieved
in mind and heart, he pushed aside the hanging,
and entered the apartment of Ragunáth. The first
room was empty, illumined by a single lamp, the light
of which gave some indication of the richness of the furnishings.
Through this and another room Fidá passed,
and then halted on the threshold of the third, the living-room
of a fortunate man.</p>

<p>Here, reclining on a great pile of cushions, was the
adviser and confidant of the Rajah. Beside him, on a
low stand, were a dish of rice and a chased goblet containing
wine. Two attendants were bathing his feet
with perfumed water; and at the opposite side of the
room, under a hideous image of Krishna, a Brahman
was making the evening sacrifice of meal and ghee,
over two or three sticks of burning wood. Fidá forgot
himself in gazing at this scene, till Ragunáth, opening
his eyes, which were shut under the soothing influence
of rest and quiet, cried out, rather harshly:</p>

<p>“Come! Enter, slave! To thy knees!”</p>

<p>Fidá walked slowly forward, made a respectful salutation
to the master of the room, and then stood upright
again. Ragunáth shrugged his shoulders, but
did not attempt to enforce his command, which was,
indeed, contrary to the etiquette of captivity, he being
in no way Fidá’s overlord. It was some moments
before he would speak; and, during the interval, the
Brahman, his task over, turned to him, announcing:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
“The evening Agnihotra is accomplished. Krishna
and the gods are appeased. I will depart,” and forthwith
left the room. Then Ragunáth, once more master
of his tones, said smoothly:</p>

<p>“You are here, Asra, to choose the life of your captivity.
Will you wait imprisoned and guarded till
there come members of your race to treat for ransom;
or will you take the clothing of the Rajah’s household
and become the servant of our lord, his cup-bearer,
till the time of your freedom?”</p>

<p>“Will not Rai-Khizar-Pál send messengers to treat
with Omar for my ransom?” cried Fidá, in amazement.</p>

<p>“The way is long and difficult. We are but just
returned from a dangerous campaign. The Rajah is
satisfied with his victories.”</p>

<p>For some moments Fidá stared hopelessly at Ragunáth’s
impenetrable face. Then he bent his head beneath
the tumultuous wave of bitterness that overswept
him. Finally, controlling himself, as all Arabs are
taught to do, he looked up again, and answered in an
unnatural voice: “I will enter the household of the
Rajah. I will serve him as his cup-bearer.”</p>

<p>Ragunáth nodded, and touched a gong beside his
couch. After a moment’s waiting a slave ran into
the room, knelt before his master, and bent his head to
the floor.</p>

<p>“Radai, take this man to the house of slaves, and
let him be clothed in the fashion of the Rajah’s servants.
He will serve to-night, at the feast, as cup-bearer
to the Lord Rai-Khizar-Pál. Go!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The slave rose, took Fidá by the hand, and turned
to leave the room, when they perceived that a newcomer
was standing in the doorway: a eunuch of high
office. Ragunáth, seeing him, gave an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Kasya! Enter! enter!”</p>

<p>“My lord summoned me?” The man did not
move from the doorway, and Fidá and his companion
stood aside.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I summoned thee. How goes thy office?
Enter, Kasya. All thy work is well?”</p>

<p>“The Lady Ahalya—is well.”</p>

<p>The answer was made in such a tone as brought
Fidá’s eyes to the face of the man that uttered it.
Kasya’s eyes were bright, Kasya’s lip was curled, and
Fidá perceived that the sarcasm, the almost insult, in
the eunuch’s tone had been fully intentional. In another
moment Fidá was drawn from the room, but not
before he heard Ragunáth utter a smothered oath, and
had perceived a light of satisfaction in the eunuch’s
eyes. It was an incident unusual enough to impress
itself on the mind of the new-made slave; for he was
sometimes a student of men. But there seemed no
adequate reason why one word, the name that Kasya
had spoken, should so have fixed itself in Fidá’s brain
that, for the next hour or two, it beat upon him with
a constant rhythm, “Ahalya—Ahalya—Ahalya,” till
it seemed fuller of import than the great battle-cry the
syllables of which so much resembled it. And, in the
end, Fidá accepted it as an omen of all that afterward
came upon him in this new land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>In the meantime the whole palace, and especially the
great central portion of it, had been humming with life.
Manava, the regent-minister, and all his staff of servants,
were preparing an unexpected welcome for the
return of the Rajah and his victorious troops. By
half-past eight in the evening, the vast audience-hall
presented a gala appearance; and shortly after
that hour Rai-Khizar-Pál, with Purán on his right
hand, Ragunáth on his left, and a great company
bringing up the rear, entered and was received at
the foot of the daïs by Manava, who, with this act
of reception, discharged himself of his three months’
regency.</p>

<p>The hall, which was the largest in the palace, and
opened immediately from the central courtyard, was a
remarkable example of the massive, clumsy, and inartistic
architecture of uninvaded India. Stone pillars,
of unequal size and design, supported the roof. The
walls were covered with multicolored hangings, and
furthermore were to-night covered with ropes of flowers.
A hundred lamps of wrought bronze and silver
hung from the ceiling, and torches were fastened to
the pillars. At the head of the room, opposite the
entrance, was the daïs, on which stood a broad divan
overhung with a canopy. This was the judgment
seat of Mandu, to be used to-night in a lighter
cause. As the Rajah laid himself in his place, the
three high officials squatted on cushions near the
royal couch, each with a low, round stand before him.
Below, in the hall, stood three long, low tables, raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
not more than eight inches from the floor, beside
which were rows of woven mats, on which the feasters
squatted in customary fashion. In three minutes every
seat was taken, and immediately a throng of slaves
came hurrying in, each bearing his burden of food or
wine or metal bowls filled with water for the washing
of hands. Among these ministers of the feast was
Fidá, who came halting along in the rear, side by side
with the young Ahmed, now perfectly content by reason
of the nearness of his lord. Fidá was dressed in
a loose white cotton vestment that hung to his ankles,
and was confined about his waist with a broad, red
scarf. The sleeves were wide and short, and the
tunic opened loosely in the front, disclosing his bare,
bronzed chest. His feet were unshod; but his head
was bound round with a brass circlet, the sign of
slavery. In his hands he carried a jar of the liquor
forbidden to his creed. As he neared the royal divan
many eyes were turned to him, and he was pointed out,
here and there, as a prince of the enemy; and if the
feasters gazed at him once for his station, they looked
a second time at his beauty, for Fidá was worthy of his
birth. Taller in stature, better shaped as to limb,
cleaner-cut in feature than any Indian, he gave ample
evidence of the higher civilization and keener intellect
of his race. For at this time the men of Arabia were
at the zenith of their power; and were bearing the religion
of their Prophet at the point of their swords into
every nation of the known world.</p>

<p>Fidá went up and bent the knee before his master;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
and Rai-Khizar-Pál turned upon him a gentle and
kindly glance. “Come up, young man. Let me behold
thee. So. Thou art named master of my drink.
Fill, then, this cup, and Indra grant it may be full
forever!”</p>

<p>Fidá obeying this command, the Rajah lifted the
golden vessel to his lips, and instantly all those in the
room sprang to their feet. He drank deeply, replaced
the cup on the stand before him, waved one hand to
his people, and the feast was opened.</p>

<p>To Fidá, tired, dreary, and, above all, famishing
with hunger, the meal seemed endless. It was not,
indeed, a refined sight to one suffering as he suffered.
Flagon after flagon of wine he poured into the Rajah’s
bowl, dish after dish of the richest food was presented
at the royal stand, mountain after mountain of meat,
river on river of drink, disappeared under the attacks of
the feasters below; and still there was no end. One
man alone, of all the number, displayed some fastidiousness
in his taste. Ragunáth, after a moderate
meal, ceased to eat, and sat cross-legged on his cushion,
silent, motionless, oblivious, seemingly, of the sights
and sounds around him: untempted by any viand or
wine to exceed his capacity. In spite of this fact Fidá
could not regard the man with admiration or even
with respect. For to the prejudiced eyes of the slave,
delicacy in Ragunáth only assumed a guise of affectation.</p>

<p>Time went on, hours apparently had passed, and
still Fidá’s ministrations as cup-bearer showed no sign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
of diminishing. Finally, however, relief came from an
unexpected source. Kasya, the head eunuch, whom
Fidá had already seen, glided into the room through
a small door to the right of the daïs, connecting the
audience hall with the Rajah’s private apartments.
Kasya knelt before Rai-Khizar and murmured a few
words which brought the royal master to his feet, exclaiming
to those near him:</p>

<p>“Come, my friends, let us go. There is to be
dancing.”</p>

<p>Purán and Manava rose at once from their cushions,
Ragunáth emerged from his spell, and the three of
them, with Kasya and one or two slaves, followed the
Rajah from the room, unnoticed by the rabble below.</p>

<p>Fidá, to his infinite relief, found himself left behind.
He realized, indeed, that he was at the end of his
endurance; and this fact made him bold. Going to
Ragunáth’s place, he sat down and set to work upon the
untouched food left there. Never had slave been so
daring before; but, also, never before had a meal been
so direfully needed. As he ate, he regarded the crowd
below apprehensively; for he did not know what discovery
might bring. But the great feast was nearly
at an end. Half the company had gone straggling off
to their beds. Of those that remained, few were in
condition to observe anything; and, to his reassurance,
Fidá presently perceived that slaves and servitors had
begun to slip into empty places, and to begin their part
of the meal. Among this number was Ahmed; and
when presently the eyes of the two met, Fidá nodded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
slightly, and the other came running to the daïs, and
stood before his master.</p>

<p>“Sit here by me, and eat, Ahmed,” commanded the
young man.</p>

<p>“My lord! It is not fitting—”</p>

<p>“Sit here. Am I not a slave also? There! Here
is lamb roasted with cinnamon and stuffed with
raisins and sugar. Excellent! Eat of it. And this
is deer flesh. And here is sesame, and rice, and a duck
fried in oil. They do not starve in Mandu; but I
have seen no water in this room.”</p>

<p>“I will fetch it!” and Ahmed darted away, to return
presently with the prescribed liquid in a large, porous
bottle.</p>

<p>Fidá drank gratefully, and then the two ate in
silence, while below them, minute by minute, the great
hall grew quieter. The meal was almost finished, and
Fidá was smiling at the contentment of his devoted
little servitor, when suddenly a eunuch came running
through the Rajah’s door, and, seeing Fidá seated tranquilly
on the daïs, gave him a violent cuff on the head,
crying out:</p>

<p>“Dog! Leave thy gluttony and come to the King.
He calls for his ‘cup-bearer’.—Faithful cup-bearer
thou! Come!”</p>

<p>At the blow, both Mohammedans leaped to their
feet; and the Asra stared upon the eunuch, his face
flaming with anger. Ahmed, indeed, would have
thrown himself upon the man, but that Fidá fortunately
regained his temper, and, restraining the lad’s arm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
bent his head before the messenger, and with a slight
smile at Ahmed’s outraged expression, followed his
guide from the room.</p>

<p>They passed through a hallway more richly furnished
than any Fidá himself had ever seen; and then, crossing
a corridor, turned down a narrow passage into the
open doorway of the “theatre”—a large, irregular
room, with a slightly elevated platform at one end, and
the usual daïs at the other.</p>

<p>The place was brilliantly lighted. Rai-Khizar-Pál
lay upon a divan; and disposed about him were his
usual companions, together with one or two new officials,
and a dozen or more slaves, who crouched back in
the shadow of the hangings. In one corner of the room,
below the stage, sat three musicians, playing, upon
their strange-shaped instruments, a rhythmical minor
air. The stage was occupied by six nautch-dancers,
gayly and scantily clad, of their type good-looking,
perhaps. They were performing a dance with which
Fidá was familiar enough, having seen it many times
at Delhi. It was called the “serpent”, and appeared
to be highly acceptable to the spectators. The Rajah
was laughing and talking genially, and even Ragunáth’s
face wore a smile. At the entrance of Fidá,
Rai-Khizar called him to the couch and good-naturedly
abused him for deserting his post. The Arab offered
no excuse, and was finally ordered to his task of pouring
wine. Cups and jar stood close at hand; and from
time to time the whole company drank a toast to
some favorite performer. Fidá, refreshed by food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
and encouraged by the leniency of his master, watched
the stage with some interest. In the course of an hour
many dancers came and went. There were sometimes
six, again two, occasionally one, on the stage; and all the
time the low, droning, monotonous music never ceased.</p>

<p>In time the audience began to grow drowsy under
the effects of light, wine, and unceasing sound. Rai-Khizar
had nodded on his pillows, and Ragunáth
yawned openly. By and by all the dancers left the
stage, and the musicians’ tune died away. The Rajah
started up, demanding to know why the dance stopped
without his command. But, while he spoke, the music
began again, this time with a different air, a swinging,
graceful melody, new to its hearers. A little murmur
of approval came from Manava and Purán. The rest
waited. Then Fidá, his curiosity awakened, saw a
woman run on to the stage:—a woman fair-skinned,
dark-eyed, with a wreath of poppies woven into her hair,
and garments of scarlet gauze flying about her slender,
beautifully shaped figure. For an instant he shut his
eyes; and, before he could open them again, there burst
from two throats the same hoarse cry:</p>

<p>“Ahalya!”</p>

<p>Rai-Khizar-Pál and Ragunáth together had started
to their feet; but she who danced only smiled and half
lowered the lids of her dark and lustrous eyes.</p>

<p>“Ahalya!” shouted the Rajah, in a frenzy of excitement.
“Ahalya! Get thee from this room! How
darest thou appear—in this place? Kasya—take her
away!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>As the enormity of his wife’s offence grew upon him,
Rai-Khizar’s wrath waxed hotter till he stood panting
with emotion as Kasya dashed upon the stage.
Ragunáth, entirely forgetting himself, stood still,
gazing upon the charming figure of the young woman,
with a light in his eyes that was all too easy to read.
Of the rest, slaves and officials alike watched the scene
with impartial interest, all but Fidá, who, even after
Ahalya, rebellious and laughing at her escapade, had
left the room, still crouched in the shadow of the
canopy, the blood pounding at his temples, his heart
literally standing still, his brilliant eyes staring as at
the vision of the wonderful red and white beauty of
Ahalya, youngest wife of Rai-Khizar-Pál of Mandu in
Malwa.</p>

<small>THE INCEPTION OF A FLAME</small></h3>
</div>

<p>Fidá slept that night on a divan in an antechamber
of the Rajah’s suite, instead of in his lawful place, the
house of slaves behind the palace. This breach of duty
came about simply enough. After the tumultuous
breaking-up of the party in the theatre, the slaves in
attendance on the Rajah and his officials seized the opportunity
for retiring, and disappeared with such quiet
zeal that, three minutes after Ahalya’s departure from
the stage, Fidá found himself alone on the daïs in the
empty room. Rai-Khizar had rushed away to his delinquent
wife; and the officials, tired out, lost no time
in betaking themselves to their own apartments. Fidá
was perfectly well aware of the situation of the house
of slaves. He had dressed there in the early evening.
But the Asra had no intention of passing the night
in that uninviting spot if it could be helped. After a
moment’s consideration, therefore, he left the theatre
and wandered through the tangled web of little rooms
constituting the royal suite, till he came upon one room
which promised comparative safety for the night. It
was unlighted. He believed it to be out of the way of
the more inhabited part. And all round it ran a divan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
well covered with cushions. So, without stopping to
consider consequences, Fidá lay down upon the pleasant
couch, buried his tired head in a pillow, and in five
minutes was sleeping the sleep of the slave.</p>

<p>He woke by degrees. First there was the consciousness
of light; secondly of a weight upon his heart;
thirdly it was extraordinarily still. Evidently he was
not in camp. Was it Delhi—the palace? He opened
his eyes to see—and he saw. Memory brought a groan
to his lips; but he stifled it, half-uttered, and lay still to
consider his situation. The first thing that occurred
to him was that it must be past the hour of morning
prayer. Rising, then, he turned his back to the sunlight
that streamed in through a half-screened window,
and, having gone through the form of ablution permitted
when water is not at hand, he began the <i>Niyyat</i>, speaking
in Arabic. The syllables fell lovingly from his
lips, and his heart swelled with the comfort of his religion.
Except the moment at Ragunáth’s door on the
previous evening, this was the first solitude that had
been his since the day of battle in which he had been
taken captive by the Rajah. During the succeeding
days he had stumbled through his prayers as he lay
bound in tents, or rode, strapped to the mule, along
rough paths through the hills. At last he was alone,
unhampered, free to take the attitudes of prayer, free
also to whisper the words of his own tongue, which of
late years he had seldom used in ordinary intercourse
with men.</p>

<p>Yet Fidá was not to end his devotions as he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
begun them. He was standing with eyes cast down,
repeating the <i>Subhán</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Holiness to thee, O God!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And praise be to thee!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Great is thy name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Great is thy greatness;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is no deity but thee!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">when a figure suddenly appeared in the doorway, and
the captive’s words were stopped short as he met the
eyes of Rai-Khizar-Pál, his conqueror.</p>

<p>So amazed was he that Fidá forgot to kneel or to
give any sign of abasement. Thus they stood, gazing
each at the other. Perhaps some mute message was
carried from the slave to the master; for the Rajah’s
expression little by little softened, till at length he
asked quietly:</p>

<p>“What is it thou doest here, Asra?”</p>

<p>Fidá bent his head. “Mighty lord, I prayed.”</p>

<p>The Rajah smiled slightly, lifted one of his hands to
the curtain beside him, grasped it, and settled into an
easier position. “Thou art not a good servant, Asra,”
he observed at last.</p>

<p>“It has not hitherto been my place to serve, O King.”</p>

<p>There was another pause, while the Rajah’s eyes
travelled around the room. “Thou hast slept here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And why? Knowest thou not the house of
slaves?”</p>

<p>For a second Fidá hesitated. Then he answered,
“Too well I knew it, Lord Rajah.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“What sayest thou?”</p>

<p>“Thou, O King—wouldst thou lie among the base
born?”</p>

<p>“<i>I!</i>—I am Kshatriya! Among you there is no
caste.”</p>

<p>“There is pride.”</p>

<p>Rai-Khizar laughed. “Thou’st a tongue, slave. It
were my duty to have thee whipped. But this day is a
day devoted to the gods. Begone, then. Get thee a
morning meal and wait for a message from me. Yet
remember this, my Asra: here there is no prince but
me. If thou anger me, I shall have thee killed.”</p>

<p>“You dare not!” rose to Fidá’s lips, but he checked
the words; for it was indeed time that he learned his
place. And he stood with lowered head as the Rajah
turned away and left him.</p>

<p>This encounter strongly affected Fidá’s state of mind.
Reconsidering the conversation, he perceived that he
stood the debtor of the man whose slave he had become—an
infidel dog, a worshipper of images and Jinn. It
could not be denied that Rai-Khizar’s toleration was
greater than that of any Arab chief; and Fidá felt
bitterly the humiliation of his leniency. Yet in all the
Rajah’s mildness there had been a dignity that inspired
in the Mohammedan an unwilling admiration and
respect.</p>

<p>Perfunctorily, Fidá finished his prayers, and then
acted upon the first of the two commands of his master:—he
left the palace in search of food. It was some
time, however, before he found it, and then only in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
house of slaves, where a number of his fellows were beginning
the morning meal. Among them was Ahmed,
who sat a little apart from the chattering herd, apparently
watching for some one. At sight of Fidá he
rose eagerly and ran forward, greeting him with marks
of respect which the Asra reproved. Then the boy
led the way into the interior of the dirty, barren house,
in the centre of which was a wood fire, overhung by a
large iron pot filled with a bubbling mass of millet.
Near by, on a stand, was an immense bowl of clarified
butter, or “ghee”, which, mixed with the meal, formed
the staple as well as the sacrificial food of the low-caste
Hindoo throughout India. Fidá waited in silence while
Ahmed handily procured him a dish of the none too
appetizing mess. And then, eager to escape the vile and
smoky air of the interior, the two hurried out into the
shaded veranda, while the other slaves were eating.</p>

<p>It was now a not unpleasant scene that the captives
looked upon. The day was hot, gay with sunshine and
the chatter of birds, sweet with the perfume of the
jessamine vines, which were still covered with flowers.
The slave-house faced the angle of the palace formed
by the juncture of the central building and the south
wing. Directly opposite them was a long, wooden-pillared
arcade called the veranda, running the length
of the wing. It was covered with flowering vines, and
furnished like a great room, with cushions and stands
and hangings in place of more customary frescoes. In
the end that faced the central courtyard, invisible from
without, was a temple room, the priests of which seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
to spend the greater part of their lives lounging on
mats in the fragrant veranda. In this same side of the
palace lodged Manava’s suite and Purán’s; and at the
end of all was a wooden barracks, where the soldiers
were now just waking from the sleep induced by last
night’s festivity. A group of these hung about the
well, which stood between the house of slaves and their
domicile, waiting their turn for water. There was a
general splashing and shouting, little laughter, but also
no swearing, for the Hindoo is always clean-mouthed.</p>

<p>From their vantage-point, Ahmed and Fidá, observing
this life, found themselves entertained; for all the
human nature of the palace found vent here. The two
captives lingered over their meal, talking generally;
and presently Fidá remarked on the number of slaves
who had been passing and repassing near them.
Ahmed answered him at once:</p>

<p>“There are more than three hundred employed here—including
eunuchs, who do not sleep in this house.
I have been made a sweeper. This morning the slave-master,
Kanava, roused me at dawn, gave me a broom
of dried kusa grass and sent me, with nine others, to
sweep the corridors of the north wing.”</p>

<p>“Then thou hast had little enough sleep. Go, therefore,
lie down and rest while I sit here. By my life,
I would I knew what my duties are to be. No one
orders me about. I am given no instructions. I have
not even seen this Kanava.”</p>

<p>“Ah, dear lord, to think that thou must serve! He—Look.
There is a stir opposite.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Two slaves had entered the veranda of the south wing,
and went running down it, shouting, as they went,
some unintelligible words. At the sound, men came
pouring out of the interior rooms, and turned in the
direction of the courtyard, whither, in a moment or
two, there moved a long procession of priests, soldiers,
and petty officials. The last of these had not yet
disappeared when every rear doorway and opening in
the main building near by began to let forth slaves,
who came toward their particular house in a straggling
group of almost two hundred.</p>

<p>“It is a big sacrifice,” observed Fidá, who was familiar
enough with Indian customs to know that no Sudra
can participate in the service of the gods.</p>

<p>“Yes, early this morning there stood erected in the
courtyard a great altar, to which many men were
bringing fagots and flowers. It will be an animal
sacrifice also; for a dozen sacred cows were tethered in
an enclosure there when I passed through.”</p>

<p>“The animal sacrifice is not common. I have never
seen one. It must be in honor of victory.”</p>

<p>Ahmed did not answer. His eyes were fixed on a
man who had come out of the palace alone and was
running toward the slave-house. “That is Kanava,”
he whispered, as the man drew near. Fidá beheld a
cruel face, marked with lines of habitual ill-temper
and impatience, and rendered doubly unpleasant by the
deep pock-marks which pitted it everywhere. His
dress was that of the common slaves; but the band
about his head was of beaten silver. At his appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the clamor in the slave-house suddenly ceased.
Ahmed jumped to his feet, but Fidá remained seated,
his empty bowl in his lap. Kanava scowled at the
breach of respect, and shouted:</p>

<p>“Up, slave! Up! You are summoned. Come!”</p>

<p>Fidá rose obediently, went to the first opening in the
trellis, and stepped to Kanava’s side. Together they
started toward the palace, and the groups left behind
looked after Fidá, with new respect; for, though he had
been rash, Kanava had neither struck nor abused him,
and was now, moreover, walking not in front of him,
but at his side.</p>

<p>As they neared the palace, Fidá’s curiosity as to their
errand rose. But he would ask no questions, and Kanava
did not offer information. So in silence they entered
the palace, walked down long corridors to the audience
hall, now cleared of every trace of last night’s festivity,
and finally to the threshold of the outer door, where,
without a word, Kanava turned and left the Asra standing
stock-still before a remarkable scene.</p>

<p>He had but an instant’s view of the thing in its
entirety:—a vast, close-packed sea of people, garlanded,
decked, nay robed, in the brightest flowers; in
the centre of the living mass a high, square altar, piled
with firewood; and surrounding the altar, ranged in
symmetrical order, twelve sacred cows, twelve accompanying
priests, and twelve huge, earthen jars. All
this Fidá took in at one, swift glance. The next instant
a universal shout arose, and he was seized and drawn
through the crowd, which opened for him, by two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
young Brahmans, naked except for loin-cloths and the
sacred cord. In a moment Fidá was beside the altar,
where stood the Rajah, flaming with jewels, and
Ragunáth, scarcely less magnificent. Here, without a
moment’s delay, the bewildered captive was taken in
hand by two snatakas, and bound, hand and foot, with
ropes. Then, as at some signal, the twelve priests
began to chant those verses of the Rig-Veda that are
designed for the great Srahda sacrifice. The crowd
was silent now. There was not a whisper; there was
scarcely a movement among them all. The twelve
gray cows stood, as if long accustomed to such sights,
mildly surveying the people. Fidá felt himself like
them. He was stunned into perfect tranquillity. His
eyes wandered aimlessly; he listened without interest
to the words of the chant. He counted the number
of flowers in the garland round the neck of the nearest
cow. And all the time his mind was really circling
about one idea, too horrible to be faced. For he had
no doubt that he was to be the first offering in that
triumphal sacrifice. This was the reason for Ragunáth’s
evasion about his ransom. This was the
explanation of Rai-Khizar’s mildness. Fidá looked
toward the Rajah, whose eyes were fixed reverently on
the ground. The next instant, however, he had caught
Ragunáth’s glance, and the minister was smiling at him—a
small, cruel, white-toothed smile, a smile like a
grimace, that sent a sudden bolt through Fidá’s heart.
Ragunáth could smile upon him in his death-hour! In
that moment hatred was born in the Arab:—a hatred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
for this man, which, through all their future intercourse,
never lessened and was never still.</p>

<p>At length the chant came to an end. Fidá felt a
breath of relief; for self-control was becoming difficult.
Now, at last, he was seized by the stalwart young
Brahmans and lifted, like a log of wood, up and up
till he was laid on his back on top of the great heap
of unlit firewood. A hoarse shout went up from
the people gathered below. Fidá’s heart throbbed
to suffocation. His hair was literally rising on his
head; but he made no movement, nor did he utter
any sound. Even in his horror he remembered the
behavior of women enduring the suttee, and the
memory shamed him into stillness. Under the fierce
rays of the sun, now in mid-sky, he closed his eyes
and waited—waited for the first crackling flame
to leap upon his flesh. Evidently the time for this
had not yet come. Again the priests were praying
those endless, senseless, Vedic prayers, to Indra, to
Vishnu, to Agni—Agni, the fire-god. How long he
lay upon the pyre Fidá did not know. It was at
once a century and a second. Then the voices of
the priests were still. Once more he was seized by
the head and the feet and lifted to the ground. There
his ropes were cut. He was free again. Trembling
and faint, he found himself facing the King’s minister,
who was smiling at him still.</p>

<p>“The captive did not know,” he murmured, “that
our sacrifices are bloodless.”</p>

<p>Fidá felt himself redden, and the next instant met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the eyes of the Rajah, who was staring at him in
amazement: “Knew you not? told they you not?
Didst fear such a death? It was a needless fear.
Human blood stains not the altars of our gods. You,
the foremost of our captives, were laid upon the altar
of Indra as a sign that we attribute all our victories
to him. That ceremony is over. You are free to depart
from the sacrifice.” And, with a friendly gesture,
the Rajah turned away again, and Fidá knew himself
dismissed.</p>

<p>It was not now so easy a task to force his way
through the dense crowd; for this time they did not
voluntarily make way for him. He was fiercely possessed
with the desire, however, to escape from this
mob who had been unconscious witnesses of what he felt
to be his cowardice. And, after a persistent pushing
and edging, he found himself beyond the people and in
front of that doorway where he had dismounted the
night before. Here Ragunáth had stood and watched
him, but had not then read his soul; or, if he had,
had found there nothing of which an Asra might be
ashamed. Now!—Coward or not, that Asra was leaning
up against the palace wall, gone very faint, even
his knees trembling with the reaction of a strain that
had been greater than he realized.</p>

<p>He remained standing here for a long time, regaining
command of himself, and, afterward, attracted by
the spectacle before him. The wood on the altar had
been lighted, and a hot, wavering flame leaped high
in the centre of the garland-strewn multitude. Into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
this fire went the contents of the jars that had stood
at the base of the altar:—four of fine, ground meal,
four of ghee, and four of strained honey. From this
sacrificial mess arose a thick smoke; but the odor
that came from it was, surprisingly enough, decidedly
agreeable; for the meal and butter had been so skilfully
treated with aromatics that the natural smell
of burning vegetable and grease had been overcome.
The sacrifice was of course accompanied by a continuous
high and musical chant from the priests.
Chapter after chapter of the Vedas they repeated
without halt or break. Prayers were sent up to every
Vedic god: to Vishvakarma, the all-maker, to Varuna
and Mitra, to Agni, to Surya, to Yama, to the Ashvins,
brothers of dawn and twilight, to Rudra, the storm-god,
and Vivasat, the father of death. The sacred
cattle were offered to Prishni, the holy cow of heaven;
and, their spirits being accepted by a sign in the flame,
they were led away to resume their duties in the great
temple at the other end of the plateau. Finally, at
the conclusion of the ceremony, the last god was introduced:
he who, for many centuries, had played the
great rôle in this ceremonial: Soma, lord of the moon,
and lord of drunkennesses, whose name is that of the
plant from which the powerful, sacred liquor is distilled.
And at the first pronouncing of this name, the
sacrifice was interrupted by the arrival of fifty slaves,
who made their appearance from the great hall, bearing
on their heads jars of the liquid to be quaffed to the
great ones above. They were greeted by a long, loud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
murmur of anticipatory joy, such as no lavish display
of meal or cattle could ever call forth from the crowd.
And now at last Fidá, too well aware of what was to
follow, turned from the courtyard down the corridor
through which he had passed on the previous night, on
his way to Ragunáth’s rooms.</p>

<p>He walked slowly along the cool, dim hall, the
silence of which was refreshing. Evidently there was
not a single soul in this part of the palace; and for an
instant there rose in the mind of the captive a wild
idea of escape. He was here, alone, unseen—and
hundreds of miles away from his uncle’s army, hundreds
of miles from any possible safety. Sanity returned
as quickly as it had left him, but bringing a
new heaviness on his spirit. He came presently to the
passage that led to Ragunáth’s rooms; and, looking
down it, perceived that it ended in a bright patch of
sunlight, marking an inner court. Instinctively he
turned thither, finding himself presently on the edge of
a charming little three-cornered courtyard, shut in on
every side by vine-clad walls. Opposite the passage
ran a veranda, overrun with passion-flowers; and in a
corner near by rose a group of small tamarinds. The
courtyard was unpaved, but in the centre of it stood a
little fountain of clear, bubbling spring-water. This
place, like the corridor, was without a sign of life;
but, pleased with its homelike, pleasant air, Fidá entered
it, suddenly seized with a sense of unfamiliar delight.</p>

<p>As if in answer to his appearance, a door across from
him was opened, and out upon the veranda, and thence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
into the court, came a young woman, unveiled, dressed
in pale, flowing silk, her hips bound with a striped sash,
of the broad Indian fashion, her dark hair twined with
purple clematis. She was humming to herself a little
tune; and as she hummed, she swayed her lithe body
from side to side and stepped as a dancer does. Fidá
drew a sharp breath. She was the woman who had
danced the night before. She was Ahalya, youngest
wife of Rai-Khizar-Pál. She was—the fairest creature
that Fidá’s eyes had ever looked upon. As he
drew quickly back into the shadow of the doorway, he
knew, as one knows things in dreams and visions, that
it was her spirit filling this place that had made it dear
to him. Oblivious of himself, he stood gazing at her
while she came to the fountain, sat down upon its
brim, and dabbled her hands in the cool water, smiling
to herself the while, reminiscently.</p>

<p>Presently, lifting her eyes, she looked full upon Fidá,
and, startled out of her composure, jumped to her
feet, and then stood still again, uncertain whether she
wished to run or not. Fidá advanced matters by
walking forward into the courtyard again and performing
a deep salaam before her. She saw the metal
circlet on his head, knew him for a slave, and yet lifted
up her voice and spoke to him. What manner of
woman could she be!</p>

<p>“Who art thou? What is thy name?” she asked,
surprising herself by her unpremeditated boldness.
The beauty of her voice, however, made the slave’s
senses swim anew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“My name is Fidá. I come from Yemen. And my
race is the race of Asra—” he looked into her eyes, and
his voice sank to a whisper, as he added involuntarily,
“who must die if they cherish love!”</p>

<p>The girl started slightly; but she did not move while
he looked at her, her white face, her deep, heavy-lidded
eyes with their long, black fringes, and the
slender white throat left uncovered by her dress.
Presently she spoke again, more timidly: “Thou’rt a
captive—brought home from war by my lord?”</p>

<p>“I am a captive. I am the slave of thy lord. May
Allah pity me!” And this last was drawn from him not
by the thought of his captivity, but by the sight of her
surpassing loveliness.</p>

<p>Ahalya’s expression softened and grew wistful. “I
am a captive too,” she said. “I was born in Iran.”</p>

<p>“The land of roses! I have been in Iran. We
passed through it on our long march from Yemen.
And we rested in Teheran, where our people have
made treaties with the Shah.”</p>

<p>He hoped to see her eyes brighten when he spoke of
her country. But she only gazed dreamily beyond him
and answered: “I do not remember it—Teheran. I
was a baby when my mother brought me into this land.
She was in the house of the King of Dhár, and from there
I was married to the King of Mandu.—But thou must
go, Asra! Thou’lt be—killed if they find thee here.”</p>

<p>“Nay, lady!” Fidá suddenly fell upon one knee.
“Let me stay but another moment. Thou—thou hast
made captivity so fair to me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Hush, Asra! Go quickly. Indeed, indeed, I
would not have thee harmed.”</p>

<p>She drew back from him, and he, coming suddenly
to his senses, rose and turned away. Yet before he
reached the doorway he had twice looked back at her,
and each time found her facing him, her great eyes
shining, a half smile trembling round her lips.</p>

<p>Fidá reached the corridor on fire. It was as if he
had been drinking Soma. His blood raced in his
veins. His heart pounded. His hands were cold.
Yet he was not too much distraught to hear the sound
of some one approaching in the corridor; and, with a
quick sense of self-protection, he slipped into the
nearest doorway, and concealed himself behind the
hangings of Ragunáth’s antechamber.</p>

<p>The newcomer had come down the passage; and
Fidá, peering cautiously out, perceived, with a start,
that it was Ragunáth who was approaching—Ragunáth,
the mild, the temperate, who had left the Soma
sacrifice and come hither alone, to seek—quiet? To
Fidá’s surprise and momentary relief, he passed his
own doorway, and went on toward the little courtyard.
And now the slave, suddenly forgetting himself
in his interest in the movements of the man he
hated, stepped full into the passage and watched. In
the courtyard Ahalya was still seated beside the fountain;
but at sight of Ragunáth she rose hastily.</p>

<p>“She was here to watch for him!” thought Fidá;
and he clenched his hands at the thought.</p>

<p>Ragunáth went up to the princess and bowed before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
her as profoundly as Fidá himself had bowed. Evidently,
at the same time, he spoke. Ahalya, however,
began at once to move backward, away from him, he
following her by degrees, till they had proceeded clear
across the court. And then, suddenly, at the veranda
step, the young woman turned around, and literally
ran into the women’s apartments, whither none could
follow her.</p>

<p>Ragunáth would be coming back now, and Fidá perceived
the necessity for a quick escape. In a moment
or two he was back in the broad corridor; and, looking
round the angle into the passage, saw Ragunáth come
slowly in from the court and enter his own rooms.
From the man’s walk Fidá read enough to satisfy him.
“She was not waiting,” he thought; and at the idea
his spirits rose dizzily. Yet, after all, in this last
pleasant surmise he was wrong.</p>

<small>AHALYA</small></h3>
</div>


<p>Short of breath, flushed of face, and discomposed
in temper, the Ranee Ahalya entered her day-room
after the brief interview with Ragunáth. As she
appeared, a girl, who sat on some cushions at the side
of the room, working at a piece of embroidery, rose
and bowed, and then asked eagerly:</p>

<p>“Did he come?”</p>

<p>Ahalya flung herself down on the broad divan that
ran across the end of the room under the screened
windows. “Yes, he came,” she said, petulantly.
Then, after a moment’s reflection, she added: “I
hate him, Neila.”</p>

<p>“Did he—what did he say?” asked the handmaid,
forgetting her work as she watched her mistress.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he said. How should I? I
did not think of him. But I think he dishonors the
gods. They were all at sacrifice, and he stole away
because he does not like Soma. Nor is it good,” she
added, with a touch of sympathy.</p>

<p>“But he is a man, and should have a man’s tastes.”</p>

<p>Ahalya shrugged her shoulders, and the two of
them were silent for a few minutes, Neila waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
patiently for the mystery that she knew her lady would
reveal—in time. Presently, indeed, the Ranee began
to speak, in a low, reflective tone as if she were merely
thinking aloud. “In all those months when my lord
and the rest were away, fighting, I have thought many
times of Ragunáth, who was kind to me at my first
coming here. I thought I should be happy when he
came again. I wanted him to come. And oh, Neila,
thou knowest the days have been long and lonely,
and I have been sick for Dhár and for my mother.
My lord is very tender of me, and I know that he is
good. But he is not young and beautiful to look on.
His eyes are not bright nor do his lips smile when he
sees me. And Ragunáth seemed younger and more
in love with life. Last night, when I danced the poppy
dance, it was for him. But, Neila, I have perceived
that he is not a man. He makes me think of a snake,
with his shiny eyes and his long, still hands. He does
not burn with an honest fire.—Ugh, I hate him! So
will I tell my lord.”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt not, Lady Ahalya! Thou darest not tell
the Rajah you have seen this man! We should all be
killed!” Neila sprang to her feet, her work dropping
unheeded, while she stared at her mistress, who lay,
hands clasped above her head, staring off into space,
nor gave the slightest heed to her companion’s fear.
Thus Neila presently returned to her place and took
up her work again, not without anxiety in her eyes;
for the service of the youngest wife of the Lord
of Mandu was, to say the least, no monotonous life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
Ahalya was as erratic and as reckless as an existence
of stifled loneliness can make a young, brilliant, and
impulsive nature. And this very careless openness,
mingled as it was with a singularly pure and unsuspicious
nature, had won a place for her with every one,
from the King of Mandu down to the humblest eunuch
of the zenana. She was even tolerated by Malati, the
oldest wife, who had been born a Brahman. And than
this nothing more can be said.</p>

<p>For some moments Ahalya continued to smile into
space; which smile, considering her just-avowed aversion
to Ragunáth, Neila was decidedly at a loss to
interpret. Then Ahalya asked:</p>

<p>“Neila, have any of the slaves told thee anything
concerning the captives brought home in the Rajah’s
train?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Kasya spoke to me of one of them, who has
been made the King’s cup-bearer. He presumes
greatly on his station; for last night he would not even
sleep in the slave-house, but lay on the divan in one of
the Rajah’s antechambers, sleeping like a god. This
man was a prince of his race:—At—Ak—I cannot
remember—”</p>

<p>“Asra,” put in Ahalya, quietly.</p>

<p>“Asra! ’Tis that!”</p>

<p>Ahalya sat suddenly up and leaned forward a little.
“Kasya told you this! Said he more? What will
they do with him? Will he be ransomed?”</p>

<p>“The captive, madam?” Neila, so used to her
mistress’s whims, was still surprised at this one. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
do not know what they will do with him. Kasya did
not tell me. He was offered on Indra’s altar to-day—being
by birth Kshatriya, and the chief of the
captives.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He is a prince. Neila, I have seen this
man.”</p>

<p>“Seen him! Oh, Ranee, Ranee, be careful! Why,
he is a slave! If he were seen speaking with thee—they
would burn him!”</p>

<p>Ahalya laughed joyously. “None saw him but me.
He came before Ragunáth. And, Neila, he told me
a strange thing. He said: ‘I come from Yemen; and
my race is the race of Asra, who must die if they
cherish love!’ What could he mean by that? To die
because one loved! I should not die, I think. Neila,
Neila, <i>he</i> was young, and his eyes shone. Neila! I
am lonely! Go bring to me the young Bhavani. Say
to him that I will tell him the tale he loves most to
hear: of Prince Arjuna and the great bow and the
beautiful Princess Draupadi.” Ahalya smiled. “Go
tell him, Neila, and put away that endless work of
thine.”</p>

<p>Obediently the girl rose, left her embroidery lying
on the cushions, and went out of the room. When she
was gone, Ahalya stretched herself still more lazily on
her divan, closed her eyes to the light, and, as if she
saw with her mind things more beautiful than real,
smiled slightly, and began to sing the swaying melody
of the poppy dance. About her was a perfect stillness.
Not a sound, not so much as the tones of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
women’s voices from the interior of the zenana, penetrated
to her solitude. Perhaps her reverie was broken
by the silence, but she only smiled the more; for it
had come to be an uncanny habit with her to smile
through her loneliest and saddest hours. Only at those
rare times when joy or interest lifted her out of herself
did her face show all the strength and purity of its
melancholy beauty. Her heritage from her mother
was a self-defence of constant concealment, and a kind
of inward cynicism, which, never revealed on the
surface, was nevertheless constantly nourished and
strengthened by the many humiliations of her existence.
Just now she was considering her performance
of the evening before, and the results of it, when, after
she had left the theatre, her lord had come to her in
great anger, expecting tears, repentance, and abasement
from her, and had got only petulance, rebellion,
and remorseless laughter, so that finally, worked into
a fierce rage, he had left her alone to wake to a realization
of her offence. This realization had by no means
come; and she fully expected the Rajah to appear before
her that evening humbly craving favor; for experience
had taught her that she need never be the first to
surrender. Rai-Khizar-Pál loved her far more dearly
than she, unhappy child, cared for him, grave, honorable,
and just as he was; and it was to her carelessness of
favor and the consummate skill with which she let that
carelessness be known, that the Lady Ahalya owed the
favoritism she enjoyed and the rooms she lived in.</p>

<p>These rooms were the choicest in the zenana. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
consisted of a tiny suite of three, opening from a passage
that led directly into the main palace. The first of them
was an antechamber, heavily spread with rugs, walled
with carved wood brought from Ceylon, and lighted day
and night by a single crimson lamp suspended from
the ceiling. The second room, in which Ahalya now
lay, was a light and pleasant place, its floors covered
with silken rugs, the walls frescoed gayly with birds
and flowers, the furniture and the thousand ornaments
it contained all of the costliest variety, and, at the end
farthest from the windows, a little shrine to Rahda, the
Lady of Love. The last room, accessible only through
the other two, was the sleeping-room, its walls hidden
by silken hangings of pale purple and gold; its couch
covered with cloth of gold; the chests to hold the
Ranee’s garments, of precious woods inlaid with ivory
and pearl, lined with sandal-wood; and teak-wood toiletstands
displaying mirrors, brushes, perfumes, and cosmetics
wherewith a woman might be beautified:—a
heavily gilded room indeed, and one in which Ahalya
spent little time.</p>

<p>Beyond these apartments of the favorite wife, across
the whole length of this inner palace wing, stretched
a long, narrow room, furnished with every luxury that
Indian ingenuity could devise. This was the women’s
day-room,—their common lounging-place,—where wife
and slave met together in free converse. Around it
were ranged the rooms of the other wives: Malati’s,
where the young Bhavani, Rai-Khizar-Pál’s only son,
the heir of Mandu, lodged with his mother; Bhimeg’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the Kshatriya woman’s; and those of Chundoor, the
despised Sudra wife. At the end of the wing, farthest
from the palace, lived the women slaves; and beyond
was a separate house for the eunuchs. Such was the
zenana, in the days of Indian rule in Mandu: a place
full of life and color and sound; of interminable jealousy,
strife, and bitterness; a place which only one man
ever entered; he on whom all these women must expend
the human love and fidelity that lay seething in their
hearts.</p>

<p>In the meantime, to Ahalya, waiting on her couch,
came Neila, bringing with her a lad ten years old,
shaggy-headed, with big, black eyes, and a sturdy
figure, who went up and kissed the Ranee affectionately.
His eyes were bright with excitement as he cried to
her: “Alaha! Alaha!” (it was his name for her), “I
have been riding to-day! Kasya put me upon a horse,
and we went almost to the old temple and back. And—and
I am to go every day now!” Trained studiously
to the dignity of his birth, he gave little active sign
of his pleasure; but his face expressed his delight, and
Ahalya, more demonstrative than he, threw her arms
about him and laughed in sympathy.</p>

<p>“Beautiful, Bhavani! Beautiful! Now thou wilt
soon be given a bow; and then—”</p>

<p>“Then I shall really go and contend in the games
before the beautiful Draupadi!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Shall we play it now? You will be Arjuna,
and these cushions your horse. Pile them up! Pile
them up!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and you are Draupadi, there on the divan, and
I will ride before you and contend with—with—”</p>

<p>“Neila!” cried Ahalya: “Neila! Where are you?
There,” as the girl came in at the door, “Neila, if you
please, you are all the other princes contending for my
hand in the royal games. You are four of the sons of
Pandu, and the hundred sons of Hastinapura, and—”</p>

<p>“And I am to wrestle with you, and shoot you, and
kill all of you, Neila! And it will be splendid!”</p>

<p>And, Neila smilingly consenting to the slaughter,
the game began. For half an hour the contest raged
fiercely; and finally Ahalya herself came down from her
throne to be killed by the all-conquering one. But
at last, when the little room looked as if a devastating
army had passed through it, the sport came to an end,
and Ahalya and the little boy sat down together to
rest, while the untiring Neila began the task of setting
things to rights. It was then that Ahalya’s turn came,
and she lost no time in beginning:—</p>

<p>“Bhavani, hast seen thy father to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Oh, yes! He left the Soma sacrifice to see
me ride!”</p>

<p>“Was he—was he in a glad humor? Asked he of
me?”</p>

<p>Neila paused in her labors to hear the answer to this
question.</p>

<p>“He was very glad and gay. He gave me a piece of
silver for sitting straight on my horse. But—dear
’Laha, I think he did not ask for you.”</p>

<p>“And said he naught of any one else?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Of whom? Oh, but he just talked about me, and
my riding, and how in a few years I should go to war
with him.”</p>

<p>Ahalya laughed, but not with her eyes. “Well, I
am tired now. I am going to sleep, Bhavani. Therefore
run away. See what a mess we have made of the
room! Run away.”</p>

<p>“But—I may come again soon, to play Arjuna?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow?” wistfully.</p>

<p>“Yes. But go now, Bhavani.”</p>

<p>Obediently and reluctantly, Bhavani went.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Neila and Ahalya found themselves
looking at each other intently. “He will surely
come this evening,” said the slave. “He cannot stay
away longer.”</p>

<p>Ahalya flushed and frowned. “I do not want him
to come,” she said. “I am tired. I am going to sleep
now. Do not wake me till the evening meal is ready.”
And the Ranee forthwith disappeared into her bedroom,
pulling the purple hangings across the doorway
behind her so that Neila could not see, as she lay on
her bed, whether she slept or not.</p>

<p>Rai-Khizar-Pál did not come that evening, nor the
next day, nor the next. And by the third afternoon
Ahalya was secretly very anxious. Nothing ever went
unknown for twenty-four hours in the zenana: that
place whose inmates had nothing to do all day long
but discuss each other; and for two days now nothing
had been talked of in the common day-room but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
favorite’s fall from favor. The Lord Rajah had been
at home from his campaign nearly four days and had
seen Ahalya in that time only once! Glory to Krishna!
Who would get her place? On the afternoon of the
fourth day Ahalya, braving the worst, appeared in the
day-room. The chill of humiliation that met her was
expected, but none the less hard to endure. Malati,
when profoundly saluted, set the example for the room
by barely noticing the Ranee. The very slave-girls
laughed at her as she passed them; and only Chundoor,
the Sudra woman, offered to make room for her. Ahalya,
however, had not yet come to passing a whole morning
with a person of low caste; nor yet was she to be driven
from the day-room because Rai-Khizar-Pál was offended
with her for the poppy dance. After her one bow to
Malati, who, as oldest wife, was entitled to it, she
walked once round the room, leisurely chose out a pile
of cushions apart from the general groups, settled herself
with inimitable, lazy grace, despatched one eunuch
for sweetened rose-water, commanded another to fan
her, gave orders to three or four more, and, when she
had made herself important enough, caused Neila to
bring in a tray of toilet articles and begin to shape
and polish her nails. While Neila worked, she lay perfectly
still, surveying the company near by in a supercilious
manner, and giving her rivals ample opportunity
to realize that, try as they would, not one of them
could ever approach her in beauty, in grace, or in
charm.</p>

<p>By this time the whole room was in a ferment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
disdain and concealed envy. Suddenly, as if the
excitement had not been already great enough for one
morning, Rai-Khizar-Pál appeared on the threshold,
and looked eagerly down the room. Every head was
turned to him: Ahalya’s too, but leisurely, and with an
indifference that was noticeable. Scarcely did she
take the trouble to lift her eyelids, as the Rajah came
slowly forward. Her husband’s eyes were busy, however,
during his ceremonious progress; and he read a
deal of history in that walk. It would have been impossible
for him not to have made the comparison between
Ahalya and those from whom she had so studiously
withdrawn herself. Beside their dark, heavy, sensual
faces, hers, in its clear-cut, Persian fairness, stood out
as a rose among thistles, as gold beside brass. This
morning, after three days without her, the Rajah
appreciated her more keenly than usual; and, before
her indifference, his displeasure melted like mist in the
sun. Stopping to speak with no one else, he went to
her, amid a sensible but scarcely audible murmur of
disappointment. Ahalya looked up only when he bent
over her; but she smiled at him for greeting, and he
asked nothing better.</p>

<p>“My lotus-flower! My heart’s delight!” he said,
gazing thirstily at her fair face. “Ahalya! Thou wilt
dance no more nautch dances at the theatre?”</p>

<p>For a moment she seemed to hesitate. Then,
because she had had enough of playing for the time,
she answered, truthfully enough: “Nay, lord. I—am
sorry that I danced the poppy dance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Rai-Khizar longed to take her in his arms; but this,
in the face of all the zenana, even he scarcely ventured
to do. So, bending low over her, he whispered:</p>

<p>“In two hours come to the marble bath, and we will
eat together, alone, by the fountain there. Make thyself
beautiful for me, rose of Iran!—my treasure!—my
child!” Then, with the smile that he gave only to
her, the Rajah turned away, and left the room without
speaking to any other in it.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after he had gone Ahalya also departed,
running the new gantlet of hurt and angry glances with
less indifference than she had borne her humiliation an
hour before. Her pride served her well in trouble; but
ill-natured jealousy always cut her to the quick; and
she had found but light armor against it.</p>

<p>Returning to her own room, she bathed, and let
Neila dress her as the Rajah commanded. Her garments
were silken tissues of palest pink, delicate as
rose-petals. Her waist was girdled with gold and
pearls; and her hair braided and bound up with golden
threads. When Neila had finished her she was a picture,
and she knew it, perhaps, though she took small
delight in it; for the unexpressed thought in her heart
was that she would have matched her raiment with her
love; and Rai-Khizar-Pál she loved as a father, as a
venerable and powerful man; her master, but never the
lord of her heart.</p>

<p>The Rajah, however, was waiting her coming with
very different feelings; for he loved Ahalya as most
men love only in early youth. His delight in her was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
out of all proportion to his reserved and conservative
nature. On her he lavished the wealth of his treasury.
For her he would have sacrificed, without a thought,
every other woman in his zenana. And while her escapades
and her insubordination never failed to startle
and hurt him, they only served, in the end, to bind her
more strongly to him by the chains of fascination and
elusiveness.</p>

<p>The place where the two were to sup together was
the Rajah’s favorite retreat:—an open-roofed, white-colonnaded
room, in the centre of which was a broad,
marble bathing-pool. Beside the water grew grasses
and flowers, carefully tended; and near at hand, on
the marble pavement, were piles of cushions, low
stands, and all the articles of Oriental furniture necessary
to a retreat where even slaves were not allowed
to come without command. By night the marble terrace
was lighted with lamps placed on stands; and now,
in a soft glow of rosy light, beside an ebony table spread
with choice dishes and rare wines, the Rajah lay, appreciating
the change of this miniature fairy-land from
the rough existence of camps and battle-fields; and
waiting for that which should put a finishing touch to
his deep content.</p>

<p>She came, the Ranee of his soul, unattended, her
delicate garments floating about her like a cloud. At
sight of her he exclaimed, and she went to him, smiling
and holding out her hands, secretly desirous that he
should not kiss her face. She had her wish. Scarcely
daring to touch her in her delicacy, he put her off at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
arm’s length, and gazed at her in a kind of wonder
that such a thing should be human.</p>

<p>“Beautiful one! My princess! Sit there and let
me look at thee. Most exquisite one! Art thou too
frail to eat?” He smiled at his fears, and began to lay
before her the various dishes. “See, here are mangoes,
and figs, and tamarinds, and little custard apples.
And here is a kid cooked in sugar. And rice—and
all these sauces. And there is a cup of the wine of
Iran, from thy mother’s land, beautiful one.”</p>

<p>With his own hands he served her, talking inconsequently,
content just to gaze upon her roseate presence.
And Ahalya, who had been wont to enjoy this patent
adoration, sat wondering at herself that it had become
painful to her. She strove well to conceal her feeling,
not knowing what to make of it. And she ate,
smiled, and praised the food and wine, but could think
of nothing else to say. She was dreading the time
that was coming; but she could not put it off. When
both had eaten enough, and when another jar of Persian
wine had been opened for the Rajah’s use, and Ahalya
had washed her hands in a silver basin filled with rose-water,
Rai-Khizar lay back on his cushions, called the
Ranee to his side, and began tenderly:</p>

<p>“Thou’rt glad, beloved of mine, that I am returned
to Mandu?”</p>

<p>Ahalya sighed. “I am glad,” she answered. “Oh—the
days have been dreary! The weeks would not
pass. Loneliness hath killed my soul. Hath my lord
ever dreamed of the sadness of women’s lives when
they are left alone in the zenana?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Rai-Khizar laughed, misunderstanding her words; but
Ahalya flushed with anger that he mocked her earnestness.
Seeing her expression, his changed at once.
Laying one hand on hers, he said, gently:</p>

<p>“Thou hast been lonely, beautiful one? Tell me of
it.”</p>

<p>“How can I tell thee, who hast not been a woman?
There are we left, day after day, hating and hated
by those with whom we live. And we must dress and
powder and perfume, eat, drink, sew, and be content
that we have beds to sleep on by night and a prison
to house us by day. If I leave the palace and wander
abroad in the fields, under the bright sun, the women
chatter and the slaves stare, and bearers must be at my
heels to carry me if I tire. I cannot sleep away my
days. Rather I would live like the Vaisya women, who
are free to labor, and laugh, and grow hungry and
weary with their toil. The monotony, the idleness of
my life, kills my soul! It is for this I danced the poppy
dance. It is for this I sometimes sit for hours in the
old, ruined temple of Surya, watching the monkeys
play in the cotton trees. It is for this I shout and sing
and tear to pieces my silken garments, and break the
ivories you bring me from the south. For I am not of
Hindoo blood. My mother came from free Iran, and I
am also of that race. And here, in this sleepy indolence,
I suffer—I stifle—I die! There! Is it enough?
Have I told thee?”</p>

<p>She stopped, hot and eager with the feeling of her
speech, to find Rai-Khizar staring at her with troubled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
eyes. He gave her a long and close scrutiny; and
when he spoke it was only to say, in a quiet tone:
“Thou wilt do well to crush this spirit, Ahalya. I
cannot make thee a man;—nor would I if I could.
Therefore, being a woman, thou must be protected as
one. Speak of this no more. Nay, listen, and I will
tell thee of our campaign, of the battle on the plain of
Dhár, and of these men of the west that are worthy
warriors. Thou knowest, Ahalya, that, hundreds of
seasons ago, there came, over the snow-clad mountains
of the north, a great host, led by one called Mahmoud
of Ghazni. They came, in the name of their one God,
to conquer our country; and though many hundreds
of times Indians and Rajputs drove them back, they
have persevered, and are now masters of the north and
east. In Lahore, their kings have ruled for generations;
and now a slave sits on the throne of the new
Kingdom of Delhi.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And out of Delhi a fresh horde
has come for the conquest of Malwa. Beyond the walls
of Dhár we met them in battle; and, by Indra and
Vishnu, we routed them well! I have brought back in
my train the nephew of their leader; and I think it
will be long ere Omar crosses the Vindhyas to get him
back!”</p>

<p>“Thou hast brought home the nephew of their
leader! What glory for thee! Is he to be ransomed?”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Aybek, a slave of Mahommad-Ghori, founded the present Kingdom

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“No, by my life! I like the fellow, and I have made
him my cup-bearer. He pleases me with his manner.
He is like thee:—rebellious. Why, look you, on the
first night of his captivity he slept in one of my
rooms here—would not go into the house of slaves,
and so put me to the blush for asking a prince to demean
himself, that I have granted him a bed in one
of the antechambers near my sleeping-room. Also,
yesterday, at the noon meal, he ceased to fill my cup
after the second jar was empty. I asked him why he
failed in his duty, and he answered that he did not fail,
but was, rather, careful of my welfare:—that the gods
had made kings to be examples to their people; and
that a drunken king bred drunkenness in his subjects!”</p>

<p>Ahalya’s eyes shone. “And thou—what didst thou,
my lord?”</p>

<p>“I gave the fellow ten lashes for his impertinence.
But I like him, and I shall keep him in my service.”</p>

<p>“Keep a prince for thy slave, lord?”</p>

<p>“Whoorroo, Ahalya! Thou hast his tongue to-night.
Come; I am weary of talking. Dance for me—the
poppy dance, if thou wilt, now we are alone.”</p>

<p>Ahalya rose submissively, and poised herself, while
the Rajah lay back in deep comfort on his pillows.
She was a beautiful dancer when she chose to dance;
and she could hum her own music, beating the rhythm
with her feet as she swayed slowly from one posture to
another. But she did not dance the poppy dance to-night.
She only made a series of tableaux that would
have delighted the soul of an artist, and which fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
satisfied the eyes of the Rajah. Ahalya circled round
him like some broad-winged bird, moving more and
more lightly, becoming more and more cloudlike to his
stilling senses. And presently when, out of her gauzy
mist, the Ranee looked at him, she perceived that his
eyes were closed and that his breath was coming deeply
and regularly.</p>

<p>Ahalya experienced a sudden feeling of relief. He
slept. His sleep would wear the night away. She was
free to go. Joyously, softly, swiftly, she passed out of
that room and the next; but in the antechamber beyond
she paused. Three or four rooms and a passage lay
between her and the zenana. These she appeared to
be in no haste to traverse. Halting indecisively, she
stood looking about her as if in search of something—or
some one; and her brow was drawn in meditation.
Then, all at once, she started, not in the direction of her
apartments, but through another door that led off into
a long range of rooms, little used, in one of which the
captive slave of Rai-Khizar-Pál had had the audacity
to sleep on the first night of his coming to Mandu;
and the use of which the lenient Rajah had afterward
granted him. As she continued on her way, Ahalya’s
excitement and her speed increased until she was
fairly running along, her eyes, meantime, swiftly examining
each room as soon as she entered it. At last,
when her breath had become panting, and her color unnaturally
brilliant; when, as it would seem, she began
to realize what she was doing, she reached, by her devious
route, the antechamber to the zenana, where an eunuch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
stood on guard. And he stared in amazement at
her flushed and frowning face as she hurried past him
into her voluntary captivity.</p>

<p>It was as well that the Ranee Ahalya sought her sleep
that night without having peered out of her screened
windows into the inner court; for had she done so,
she might have found by accident that which she had
unsuccessfully sought. For, till a very late hour that
night, Fidá, the slave, risking his life, crouched in the
shadow of the fountain of that court, watching, with
burning eyes, the glow of a single lamp that shone in
the Lady Ahalya’s rooms: a lamp which, though he
knew it not, was never extinguished. And so, when
weariness finally overcame him, he crept away without
learning whether or not the lady of his dreams was
sleeping behind her imprisoning walls.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE ASRA RUBY</small></h3>
</div>


<p>It was some time past midnight when Fidá, baffled
and exhausted, returned to his antechamber, and,
wrapping himself in his white cloak, lay down on the
floor. Weary as he was, he could not sleep at once,
but lay for a little while thinking profitlessly on what
he had done. Fate had twice given him that which he
had not sought. But now, trying to circumvent Fate,
he had been doubly defeated; for, had he been where
he should that evening, Ahalya, in her reckless search,
must have come upon him. This, happily, he did not
know; but he was none the less unrighteously angry
at his failure to find out something, even the smallest,
of her habits. <i>Her</i> habits! Reason, which he had
persistently smothered, rose up against him, and began
to lay before him certain grim truths. This woman,
of whom his nearly every waking thought was now
composed, was a Ranee—a queen, a wife. To her
he was an outcast, and yet he had dared to lift his
thoughts to her. Fool that he was, he had got himself
into a state men called love! What love could be
more unholy than his? She was a Ranee. But,
argued his other self, he was himself a prince by birth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
and the actual head of a great race. Nevertheless, this
race of his was a strangely unhappy one; and he, Fidá,
had, all his life till now, persistently avoided women;
for to his family women were fatal. He had taken
the highest pride in his reputation for coldness, for
chastity, for temperance. At sixteen he had left Yemen
to put himself under the guardianship of his uncle,—a
power at the court of Delhi; and, upon his departure for
India, he had vowed lifelong devotion to the extension
of the Prophet’s power; and had determined to allow
no human temptation to conquer him. This present
matter, however, he protested, was no temptation. It
was even most unlikely that he should see the woman
again, considering the difference in their present
stations. Nevertheless, after a little more chaotic
thinking, Fidá took from a certain secure hiding-place
in his vestment a tiny golden box, scarcely half an inch
square, fastened by a minute spring. Without opening
it, he clasped this box closely to his breast; and, as if it
held some magic power, under its pressure he grew
calm again, his brain ceased to throb, sleep stole upon
him, and little by little his hold on it relaxed, till at
last his hand fell from his breast and his treasure rolled
upon the floor.</p>

<p>Fidá’s awakening was sudden. The tones of a loud
voice, calling confusedly, mingled themselves with his
dreams. Then he sprang to his feet to find the Rajah
standing over him, in a most dishevelled state, crying
to him to bring drinking-water, instantly. And Fidá,
startled and sleepy, hurried away on his errand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>When he returned with the desired drink, he found
his master in his bedroom, surrounded by half a dozen
attendants, each ministering to him in some way.
Way was made with alacrity for the cup-bearer, however;
for Rai-Khizar greeted the appearance of water
with a positive roar of eagerness. After three brimming
gobletfuls had been quaffed without pause, the
Rajah gave a great sigh and sank back on his cushions.
“By the fingers of Ushas,” said he, “that is the best
liquor ever brought me! Fidá, thou abstainer, where
learned thy people their wisdom?—Now I bathe. Let
a meal be ready when I return, and summon Lord
Ragunáth to eat with me. Sacharman, go rouse him.
Thou, Asra, say thy prayers, and then come and wait
at my table. Away! Out of my sight!”</p>

<p>There was a general scurrying, in the midst of which
Rai-Khizar, restored to tranquillity, walked away to his
bath, leaving the room free for other slaves to prepare
in it the morning meal. In half an hour, when the
King reappeared, all was in readiness, and Fidá stood
alone behind his master’s seat. The Rajah seated himself
at once; but, not greatly disposed toward food,
sat waiting for Ragunáth before beginning his meal.
The official did not long delay, though he made his
appearance in no way hurriedly. He was carefully
dressed, fresh-colored and smiling; and in his hand he
carried a tiny, golden box. Fidá perceived it at once,
and his heart throbbed with anxiety, but he did not
speak. Greetings passed between Rajah and minister,
and then Ragunáth took his place opposite Rai-Khizar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
and laid Fidá’s box on the low brass table in front of
him.</p>

<p>“This was upon the floor in the second antechamber,”
he observed.</p>

<p>The Rajah took it up and examined it, Fidá still
silently watching. For a moment Rai-Khizar seemed
to consider. Then, suddenly turning to his slave, he
exclaimed: “’Tis thine, Asra! I remember they found
it on thee in my tent in the plain of Dhár, and returned
it to thee again, it being a charm of thy god.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is mine, O King.”</p>

<p>Rai-Khizar-Pál examined it further, with curiosity.
“Doth the box open? What is its power?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It contains a charm, great Rajah, the charm of my
race.”</p>

<p>“Show us this charm,” demanded the master, handing
the box to his slave.</p>

<p>Fidá’s hand closed upon it with visible eagerness;
but he was very loath to open it. However, there
was no choice. Touching the delicate spring, that
was almost undiscoverable, the golden lid flew open,
and Fidá turned the box upward on his palm. When
he lifted it, there lay in his hand a stone, red and
brilliant: a ruby, as magnificent a gem as the Rajah
had ever looked on. It was cut and polished, and
from its prismatic sides shone an inward fire of palest
crimson. This stone Fidá placed in the Rajah’s hand,
who received it with an exclamation of wonder.</p>

<p>“Whoorroo! There is not, in all Mandu, a gem so
wonderful! Thy family, Asra, must be powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
indeed! Come, as the price of keeping thy treasure,
relate to us its merits as a charm, and how it
came to be thine.”</p>

<p>Fidá was deeply troubled. He gazed at Ragunáth,
who, forgetting himself, was leaning over the tray, his
eyes fixed—was it hungrily?—upon that gleaming
stone. There was an eagerness in the clear-cut face
that was too easy to read; and as he watched, Fidá
saw the man’s hands fairly tremble for the gem.
Rai-Khizar-Pál was wholly different. His face, as
he examined the stone, expressed pleasure; but there
was not a hint of avarice in his large, quiet eyes.
After three or four minutes of hesitation and inward
struggle on the part of Fidá, the King exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Thy tale, Fidá! Or wouldst really lose the jewel
to me?”</p>

<p>“The jewel,” cut in Ragunáth, in a smooth, quiet
voice, “belongs by right of war to the Rajah. No slave
should possess such a fortune as this.”</p>

<p>“Ah, good counsellor, there thou’rt wrong. This
Mohammedan is not a Sudra. Moreover, he does not
carry the ruby as riches, but for a reason that we wait
to hear. Come, Fidá, speak!”</p>

<p>The King laid the ruby on the tray before him,
and began to eat, slowly. At the same time Fidá,
overpressed, entered upon his tale; and during the
whole of the recital his eyes never once rested on the
jewel, but were fixed unwinkingly on Ragunáth’s
æsthetic profile.</p>

<p>“O conqueror, the story of this jewel that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
bid me tell is stranger than you think. ’Tis such a
story as is scarcely to be found outside of fairy lore.
And yet I stand here to prove that it is true.</p>

<p>“Know that my race, the Asra, are an ancient and
powerful family, that have dwelt for many centuries in
Yemen, the holy land. We are of high descent, and
among us, at the time of the Hejira, was a follower
of Mohammad, afterward one of the writers of the
Koran, a venerable and a holy man, accounted a sage:
by name, Hussen el-Asra. At the same time there
lived in Mecca the high and holy Osman, compiler
of the Koran, worshipped throughout the city as a
saint. Now Hussen had a son, a young man of great
beauty of face and form, and of highly virtuous mind,
called Abdullah. One day this young man, by an
unhappy accident, chanced to see a maiden, the daughter
of a wealthy nobleman of Mecca, Said ibn-Alnas;
and in the first sight of her he loved the maiden,
and, going to her father, asked her hand in marriage.
Said received Abdullah in the most courteous manner,
but was distressed by the object of his visit, in that
his daughter had already a suitor in old Osman, who,
though four times married to virtuous women, had
become so enamored of the beautiful Zenora that he
purposed divorcing himself of one of his wives in
order to marry her. Abdullah, however, was unmarried;
and the venerable Said preferred to make
his child the first wife of an honorable man, to bringing
dishonor on the head of another woman by marrying
her to Osman. Zenora, likewise, when the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
was laid before her, as is our custom with our women,
begged earnestly to become the wife of the younger
man, whom she already loved. Thereupon, before
Osman was made aware of the matter, Zenora and
Abdullah were safely married, and she had taken up
her abode in the house of her husband and her husband’s
father.</p>

<p>“When news of this wedding was brought to the
saint Osman, he fell into a violent rage of despair.
Praying to the Prophet for vengeance, the Prophet
listened to his prayer, and put into his mouth a curse.
And so Osman went into the market-place and waited;
and when Abdullah came thither, Osman went up to
him and cursed him and his love, and the loves of his
children and his children’s children, that whosoever of
his race should truly love a woman should die of it,
having by her no more than one son. And though an
Asra should, in his heart, cherish love for a woman and
not marry her, the curse should yet be upon him, till
in a short time their whole race should perish from the
face of the earth.”</p>

<p>“It was an unholy curse,” observed the Rajah,
deeply interested. And Fidá rejoined:</p>

<p>“So thought all that heard it; and no man looked
for it to come to pass. Yet it happened that Abdullah
and Zenora had not been wedded a month when the
husband sickened. Though he grew constantly worse,
he but clung the more to his wife, and she to him,
until it seemed that he must surely die. Then, in her
bitterness and grief, Zenora called upon her father and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
her husband’s father for aid; and the nobleman and
the learned and holy one took counsel together,
and prayed to Allah and the Archangels. And their
prayer was answered. A voice from heaven addressed
them, bidding Said bring forth the richest treasure of his
house, and then Hussen to bless it and then take it to
Abdullah for a charm against the evil of the curse; and,
while he carried it, it would give him health and bring
him children. So Said went and got this ruby, which
was renowned throughout Yemen for its size and perfection.
And Hussen, performing his part of the task,
blessed the gem and consecrated it to Allah, and took
it to his son, who by it was miraculously restored to
health. Abdullah and Zenora lived happily, and had
many daughters, but only one son, to whom the ruby was
given at his father’s death, with the word that it should
descend in time to his first-born, and so on down. In
time it was found that only those children born of
deep and lasting love were subject to the curse; but
upon these, since the time of Abdullah and Osman, the
evil has never failed to take effect when the ruby is
not worn as a protective charm. It was my father’s,
and given me by him according to the custom; wherefore
my uncle, though he married and has a son, has
devoted his life to pursuits of war and hunting, knowing
that the gentler pleasures of life are not for
him.”</p>

<p>“And hast thou never put thy stone to the test?
Hast never loved?” inquired Ragunáth, with a faintly
curling smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“No,” answered Fidá, shortly. But the Rajah broke
in:</p>

<p>“By Surya, ’tis a tale worth the price of the gem!
Take it, Asra; and I think it were well for thee to
keep it idle while thou remainest in this palace.”</p>

<p>Fidá gave a little, imperceptible start, and stared
quickly into his conqueror’s face. There was nothing
to be read in it; and surely it was impossible that the
words could have had any under-meaning. Greatly
relieved at receiving back his treasure, the Asra replaced
it in its box, which he fastened again in his
garment. As he did this he was aware that Ragunáth’s
eyes were still upon him; but Ragunáth’s
glances had annoyed him so often, that he failed especially
to note this. He had recovered his jewel; and
now the meal was coming to an end and for an hour
he would be released from duty.</p>

<p>When he was again summoned to the Rajah’s side, it
was in the great audience hall, where Rai-Khizar-Pál
officiated in his judicial state. The Mohammedan was
not a little interested in the proceedings of the long
morning; and his respect for the ability of his master
increased not a little as he watched him settle, one
after another, with ease, rapidity, and remarkable
insight, the great number of quarrels and suits brought
before him by his subjects. At the second hour after
noon, however, the court rose, and those natives
whose cases had not come up that day were told to
return on the morrow; whereupon they got up, without
comment, from where they had been sitting in rows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
around the wall, and departed to their various pursuits.
The Rajah, accompanied by Manava, retired
to eat his second meal, which Fidá served. When
it was over, he stood waiting to be dismissed; for it
was the time of day when Rai-Khizar usually slept and
the slave was accustomed to enjoy a period of idleness.
Left alone with the captive, however, the King turned
to him, and, after a few moments’ consideration, said
gravely:</p>

<p>“Asra, I have said that I would not ransom thee;
liking too well thy presence and thy service. Yet
this I have in my heart reconsidered until, though I
shall grieve to let thee go, I am willing to send envoys
to thy uncle to treat for thy ransom. Doth this
rejoice thee?”</p>

<p>Fidá fell upon one knee and pressed the Rajah’s
hand to his head. “Thanks to my lord!” said he, in
a voice muffled with emotion.</p>

<p>“Ah, thou’lt be glad to be in thine own estate
again! I send the envoys forth to-day. It should be
not more than three weeks ere thy freedom cometh.
On my life, I shall be loath to part with thee. But now
I can keep thee no longer in this servant’s garb. Thou
shalt be habited like a prince again, and wait here, my
guest, till thou goest forth.”</p>

<p>“Let the King pardon my boldness. What is the
ransom thou wouldst free me for?”</p>

<p>“Far less than thou art worth, my Asra: five
thousand pieces of copper, jewels to the worth of an
hundred cows, and the oath that the Rajah of Mandu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
and the mighty Aybek of Delhi be henceforth as
brothers.”</p>

<p>Fidá had risen to his feet; but he stood with his head
so bent that the Rajah could not see his face. “I have
a favor to ask my lord,” he said, still in the muffled
tone that could not be interpreted.</p>

<p>“Speak.”</p>

<p>“Will the Rajah permit that, till the time of my
freedom, I may remain as I am now:—the cup-bearer
of my lord?”</p>

<p>“What! Art not a prince? Wouldst thou remain
a slave?”</p>

<p>“I asked a favor of my lord.”</p>

<p>“Then it is granted, Asra. But, by the bolt of Indra,
I understand thee not!” And, displeased with his captive’s
request, he got up and strode out of the room.
Fidá stood there alone, staring at the floor, with a curling,
sorrowful smile on his lips, and a deep melancholy in
his eyes. For Fidá knew his race well; and he was
perfectly aware that, though an army of twenty thousand
Mohammedans might storm the plateau of Mandu
for the simple purpose of taking him out of captivity,
yet they would never pay one-half of the ransom demanded;
and, should they take the oath of brotherhood
with an infidel, it would be for the purpose of plundering
him at the first opportunity. Entertaining, then,
from the first, no false hope of freedom, Fidá preferred
remaining in his present state as personal servant of
a king, to mutilation and degradation when the answer
that his uncle would send should reach the ears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
of Rai-Khizar-Pál. Understanding all this, and having
the courage to face it from the first, Fidá was none the
less bitter at heart at the thought of it. And it was
with dragging steps and a darkened face that he finally
set off toward the house of slaves.</p>

<p>There, as he had hoped, he found Ahmed, unoccupied
and awake. The brightness of the boy’s face at sight
of his master roused Fidá a little from his mood, and his
eyes had lost their sombreness when, side by side with
his young companion, he left the chattering veranda,
and walked in the direction of the great courtyard.
As they went, they talked in their native tongue, and
Ahmed, his boyish spirits always light, recounted all
the gossip of under-life in the great palace which had
not come to Fidá’s ears. The Mohammedan boy had
made himself very popular even among the Indian
slaves; and he, like all servants, was in possession of intimate
details of the higher life that would have astonished
and nonplussed certain august personages. His
chatter was innocent enough, however. One of the
slave-women in the zenana had had a quarrel with
Bhimeg, the second wife, over a pet paroquet. Purán
and Kanava had had a trial of strength in wrestling,
and Kanava had come out victor. Two of the eunuchs
of the zenana were just dead of a fever. And so on,
infinitely, till Fidá had ceased to listen, and was occupied
with his own thoughts, which had suddenly turned
in another direction. After all, did he really wish to
leave Mandu? Was there not something here that
could not be taken away; something that was not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
be found in any other country of the earth? Dwelt not
the fairest woman in the world here, in the place of his
captivity? Did he really desire to leave her land even
for princely honors? Nay. It might be impossible
that he should see her again; yet always she was here,
and here only, the lady of his secret heart.</p>

<p>The two companions, loitering through the great
courtyard, finally entered the temple room of Vishnu,
that began the south wing of the palace. A curious
place, this temple, devoted to that species of half-formed
Hindooism that was at this time the prevailing
religion of India. Into this religion, as into a
gigantic pie, had been thrown pell-mell the doctrines
of ancient Vedic worship, the religion of the great
Triad, the worst side of dying Buddhism, and the Philosophies,
insulted by their anthropomorphitic company.
This temple room was a fair specimen of the mingled
faiths. On one side, decked and carved with the
symbols of fifty other gods, the images of Vishnu
and Lakshmi reclined upon a throne about which was
entwined the great serpent Sesha, symbol of eternity,
in whose coils was caught a golden lotus, from which
Brahma and the demigods had, in the beginning, come
forth. Over the head of Vishnu hung a wooden
monkey, representing Hanuman, the friend of Vishnu;
and three or four living members of the chattering tribe
dwelt in the room. Around the three other walls were
images of different gods, all comparatively insignificant,
but each with his priest and a sect, however small, of
worshippers. At any hour of the day, indeed, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
especially in the morning and in the evening, there were
to be found from one to twenty worshippers seated on
the floor before the various deities, engaged in performing
an Agnihotra or an Ishti for prosperity and good
fortune.</p>

<p>In the dusk of this holy place, lighted by its fires,
Fidá and Ahmed continued their low-voiced talk, which
had now turned upon the long-standing feud between
Kasya, chief of the eunuchs, and Kanava, the slavemaster.
Kanava was high in the favor of Ragunáth;
but Kasya, heart and soul devoted to his Rajah, found
little favor in Ragunáth’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Kanava,” Ahmed said, “is Ragunáth’s spy; and he
can go anywhere in the palace except into the zenana.
Kasya watches his eunuchs, so that Kanava has never
been able to get in there; and I have heard one of the
eunuchs say that he has tried to bribe every one of
them to let him in. They say that Ragunáth is in love
with one of the women—”</p>

<p>“What woman?” demanded Fidá, sharply.</p>

<p>“The youngest wife. They call her Ahalya.”</p>

<p>Fidá’s eyes blazed with anger. “Why is not the
Rajah told of this?”</p>

<p>“Great Allah! Every one would be killed, I suppose,”
returned the boy; and the subject was dropped.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this gossip Fidá had not told his
companion anything of the chief event of the day:—the
matter of his ransom. And, on reflection, he decided
to say nothing about it. Ahmed’s young buoyancy
could never be made to understand Fidá’s own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
view of the incident; and he could do nothing but
raise hopes that would not be fulfilled. So, after a
while, each returned to his duties, insensibly lightened
at heart by the taste of intimate and affectionate
companionship.</p>

<p>Fidá lay down in his corner, that night, tired out.
According to old habit he slipped his hand inside his
tunic and made sure that his little box was in its
place, in a pocket that he had made for it himself,
after his other clothes had been taken from him. Finding
his treasure safe, he offered up a prayer, wondered
where his uncle slept that night, still more wondered
whether the Lady Ahalya was asleep, and, with her
name on his lips, drifted off into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>He was awakened by the sense that some one was
bending over him. Next he felt the lightest touch
upon his body. A hand was slipping along him so
softly that only an acute sense could have felt it.
Then Fidá opened his eyes. Ten brown, sinewy fingers
were working at his sash. Quietly the Asra laid his
own hands on those of the marauder, and, while the
blood rushed to his heart, gripped them with the
strength of a giant. The intruder gave a soft exclamation;
and Fidá found himself looking into the eyes of
Kanava.</p>

<p>The gaze continued till the slave-master was beaten.
He turned his eyes away. Then Fidá’s lip curled,
and he spoke, his voice soft with scorn.</p>

<p>“Go back, Kanava, and tell thy master that the Asra
ruby is not for him.” And, with a violent gesture, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
flung the man away from him as one would fling a bag
of meal.</p>

<p>Without a word Kanava got up and crept out of the
room. After he was gone again Fidá relaxed, and,
curiously enough, found no difficulty in going back to
sleep. Nor did he afterward waste much time in
thinking of the mortal enemy he had made by that
night’s work.</p>

<small>POPPIES</small></h3>
</div>


<p>ON the night after the reconciliation with her husband,
the night also after her search for a slave in
the palace, the Lady Ahalya went to bed in a temper,
without having roused Neila, her maid. During
the night, while she slept, some subtle change surely
worked upon the brain and heart of the Ranee; for she
herself, and Neila too, knew afterward that this night
was, with her, the beginning and the end of all things.
For the next three or four days Neila’s life was made
miserable; but Ahalya did not attempt to account even
to herself for the freaks, moods, and whims which
changed with such rapidity that, before human power
could gratify one, the next had made the work all to
do over again. Not for an entire week did the long-suffering
attendant get an inkling of what was really
the trouble; and then she went into a state of consternation
that Ahalya made no attempt to lessen. For
the Ranee’s secret mind was running continually now,
perhaps without her own volition, on the most dangerous
of topics:—how she might see the Asra again.
This was not a matter so absolutely impossible as
Fidá deemed it. Life in the Indian zenanas was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
quite that of the harems of Arabia; though, as Ragunáth
knew, this one was certainly well guarded. By
degrees, however, Ahalya approached her end. How
it came about, who could say? But Neila found herself
presently acting in the character of a spy. This
eunuch and that she questioned; now and then she
ventured into the great courtyard or, more warily, into
the palace itself: observing, listening, asking a question
of one slave or another, till Fidá’s daily habits had
become familiar to her. Then, after so much patience,
opportunity arrived. One afternoon at the very end of
the month, after the Rajah had partaken of his afternoon
meal and gone to rest, Neila herself saw the slave
Fidá set out alone into the fields, along the old temple
road. This incident being duly reported to her mistress,
Ahalya’s face lighted like a child’s.</p>

<p>“I, too, am going to walk on the temple road! Yes,
yes, Neila, I am going! Seek not to detain me. I am
going to gather the late poppies in the temple field to
make a rouge for my face. Come, prepare me!”</p>

<p>The unhappy Neila protested violently, all her courage
failing. Gradually she had been drawn into Ahalya’s
madness; but now, brought face to face with possible
consequences, she rebelled. There was a scene between
her and her mistress such as had never been known before.
But while Neila wept on the border of hysterics,
Ahalya, the power of her great malady holding her
above such things, remained dry-eyed, firm, commanding.
What wonder that Neila in the end submitted?
Nevertheless, one thing the maid insisted on. She and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
Kasya must follow their lady, as indeed many times
before they had followed her unconventional rambles;
or Ahalya should leave the zenana only over her,
Neila’s, body.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the three set out along the
temple road, Neila bearing with her certain fiercely
given instructions that had caused her heart to grow
leaden in her breast. Kasya, as they proceeded, wondered
more and more about the relations between his
mistress and her maiden; for Ahalya was walking with
a rapidity that sent the blood into her cheeks and her
heart pounding; while the traces of tears on the other’s
face were fresh enough to denote some unusual incident
before the expedition. A little more and his suspicions,
ever ready because ever needed, would have been
aroused. But, at this juncture, Fate, more powerful
even than Love, stepped in and took command of the
day. The three had not proceeded half a mile from
the palace when there came running to them a little
slave-boy, who, halting beside Kasya, spoke a few rapid
words in his ear that turned the eunuch’s mind from
all thought of the Lady Ahalya and her walk. The
Ranee Malati, it seemed, had called for her son to be
brought to her; and the young Bhavani, the most
important person in Mandu after the Rajah, was not
to be found. For a moment or two Kasya hesitated.
He had no choice but to go.</p>

<p>“I beseech the pardon of the Lady Ahalya. I must
return to the zenana.”</p>

<p>Ahalya’s face brightened. “Go then,” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“I will send after thee another of the eunuchs.”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary.”</p>

<p>“Lady—thy lord would be angry. I dare not—”</p>

<p>“Then send Churi after us; but let him not intrude
on me.” And Ahalya, now a little angry, started on
again, Neila perforce following her. Kasya, troubled
in his mind, turned away, and set off at a run for the
palace, nor did he neglect to despatch Churi, “the
doctor,” Ahalya’s favorite slave, after the errant Ranee.
But Churi, who was more an individual than a slave,
had ideas of his own about Ahalya, and did not hurry
to follow her. He arrived, indeed, at the temple ruin,
to find Neila stationed at its entrance as if on guard.
And he had the immense self-restraint to join her
without asking any questions.</p>

<p>Fidá, in the meantime, unconscious of the little
sensation he was stirring up, was occupied in making
an exploration of one corner of the plateau. As soon
as the Rajah dismissed him he had started off by himself,
having a great desire for solitude in which to
meditate on a situation that was becoming every day
more galling to him. Two weeks had passed since the
departure of the embassy to his uncle’s camp; and he
found himself gradually beginning to hope against
hope that he would, after all, be rescued from his
slavery. For this captivity which, for a few days, had
been tinged with the glamour of adventure and romance,
had now become the most irksome, the most unendurable
of degradations. He walked for a long time,
thinking deeply, paying little heed to his way till the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
scene became too remarkable to go unnoticed. He was
two miles away from the palace when the road, which,
some distance back, had turned sharply to the left, ran
out of the flat, cultivated fields, and entered a wood
which shortly became a little jungle, the road being
cut through the heaviest undergrowth of bushes, trees,
and sinuous vines. Around him, monkeys and paroquets
chattered and screamed. The foliage was brilliant
as with a second summer; for with autumn and
the first suggestion of the second rains, summer leaps
up again over all the northwest country; and Fidá
was gazing about him delighted with the color and the
life, the trouble of his heart banished by the beauty
of nature, when suddenly his road turned again, and—ended.</p>

<p>Before him, to the precipitous edge of the plateau,
stretched a naturally clear space, in the centre of which
stood a giant building, gone all to ruin. Its huge
sandstone blocks were black with age and green with
moss and growing plants. Its veranda and great doors
were open to the daylight; and within, through openings
in the roof, bright sunlight shone. The architecture
was crude and heavy; but Fidá recognized,
without difficulty, the style of the oldest Buddhism.
And he divined correctly the history of this building,
which he had started out to find: that it had once been
a Vihara, later converted to the uses of Surya, one of
the Brahman gods.</p>

<p>The place was, like the religion it still symbolized, a
magnificent ruin. And its setting was worthy of it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
for the fields on either side were overrun with flaming
poppies, blooming for the second time in the year,
and filling the whole air with the somnolence of their
burden of opium. Beyond the fields, a fitting frame
for the picture, the jungle commenced again: a high
wall of subdued color, green and brown, splashed with
the scarlet of the wild-cotton flowers. Fidá, halting
in wonder, felt his heart suddenly grow light. Here
were poppies—her flowers. It was a propitious omen.
In his trouble, he had come upon a place devoted
to her symbols. Was it a sign to him to remain in
Mandu, hoping, however vainly, sometime to find a
way to her? Smiling a little at the Indian superstition
of his thoughts, he moved on, rambled for a time round
the rock-strewn rooms within the temple, and finally
out into the fields, where the flowers took effect on
him again and set his mind running hotly upon Ahalya,
the one woman of his world.</p>

<p>An hour had passed since he left the palace, and he
knew that in a little time he must turn his steps again
toward slavery. This thought intensified the delight
of lingering here, held by the fascination of the wild flowers.
And it was now, at the most beautiful hour, in this
enchanted spot, that she herself, Ahalya, came to him.
Fidá saw two figures appear from the trees by the
temple. Both were women. He got to his feet,
trembling a little. Only one was advancing:—dressed
all in white, the head-veil thrown back from her face,
under one arm a broad, flat basket. Yes; it was
Ahalya. Fidá perceived that he was neither blind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
nor mad. She, the Ranee, was here, with him. Hesitatingly
he advanced toward her, two or three steps,
and their eyes met.</p>

<p>Ahalya crimsoned violently; and seeing this, Fidá
grew bold. Not thinking of the enormity of his
daring, with only the memory of two empty weeks upon
him, he went straight toward her, and when he was
at her side began, passionately: “Most beautiful of
women! Lotus-lidded! Lily-faced! I behold thee, and
thou art not a dream!” And then abruptly he paused,
overcome by the situation.</p>

<p>Ahalya turned to look behind her, and Fidá’s eyes
followed hers. Churi had arrived at the ruin, but he
and Neila stood leaning against a fallen stone, their
backs to the poppy-field, evidently talking together.
The Ranee, seeing herself safe enough, became confused;
and, still half turned away from the slave,
murmured, with an embarrassed manner:</p>

<p>“I came—to gather poppies. Did my lord send
you hither?”</p>

<p>“Thy lord—sleeps,” muttered Fidá.</p>

<p>Ahalya gave a nervous start. Now that she had
attained her end, the Ranee began to wish herself
a thousand miles away, so confused was she by the
presence of this man. Fidá saw how her hands
trembled; and, emboldened by the flush of her half-averted
cheek, his heart beating furiously with a
sudden hope, he took her by the hand and gently, persuasively,
led her to the stone from which he had just
risen. Here, though she would have protested, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
caused her to sit down. “I must have the poppies,”
she found courage to say, lifting up her basket, and
suddenly smiling. “Neila and Churi may come at any
moment.” And she turned again to look at the ruin.
This time the two figures had disappeared entirely.</p>

<p>“I will get poppies for you. Wait.” And, taking
the basket, Fidá darted forward and began plucking
the tough-stemmed flowers. In five minutes the
basket was heaping full, though the assortment was
anything but select. But while he worked, his back
turned to Ahalya, all his new-born audacity suddenly
ran out at his finger-tips, and when he returned to her
with the narcotic burden, his eyes were fixed on the
ground, and he was more confused than she. He laid
the basket at her feet, and then stood, like a culprit,
before her.</p>

<p>“Let the Ranee pardon me!” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Pardon thee?” she asked, wondering.</p>

<p>“Ah, I have dared to lift my eyes to thee, and now—and
now—” his voice, unpent, rang clear.</p>

<p>“And now,” she breathed, most softly.</p>

<p>“Now,” his heart throbbed, “I cannot lower them
again!”</p>

<p>Her eyes lifted themselves to his, and she smiled
at him, half shyly, half with a beautiful pride. Seeing
that smile, Fidá’s senses deserted him. He fell
upon his knees before her, and lifted up his hands,
crying:</p>

<p>“Ahalya! I love you! I love you! I love
you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>The princess shivered, half in terror, half in—something
else. But she could not speak. Slowly, therefore,
the fire died out of Fidá’s face. His dark head,
bound with its slave’s circlet, drooped lower and
lower, till at length it rested on a stone at the edge
of her silken garment, and his face was buried in his
arms. So they remained for a long time, taking no
account of the moments as they passed, neither of them
happy, both afraid of what they had done, of the
astonishing betrayal. Fidá was sick and shaken with
his inward tumult. Ahalya sat in a rigid calm,
thinking, after a desultory fashion, of many ordinary
things that now seemed infinitely far removed from
her. The bitter weariness of her life had suddenly
disappeared; but that which replaced it, she could
not just now consider. The revolution was too absolute.
How should she readjust herself so soon?
Yet, since they were here together, free and alone,
she wished to speak; and so, in a sweet, monotonous
tone, she gave voice to many fragments that were in
both their minds.</p>

<p>“I love you. Is it not right, and holy? I love
young things, and youth, and beauty. Krishna and
Radha loved thus. Who knows how it comes? I
loved you by the well. Your eyes shone into mine,
and you smiled at me, and you were not afraid. I
loved to think of you, a captive, and a prince. Most
of all I love you here, because, Fidá—because—ah,
look!”</p>

<p>At the change in her voice the slave roused himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
as one wakes, with an effort, from some wondrous
dream. Ahalya also had risen, and was staring fearfully
at a figure that approached them out of the
shadow of the trees.</p>

<p>“Ragunáth!” muttered Fidá. “Name of the
prophet! how comes he here?”</p>

<p>“Where I am, there he is also,” murmured the
Ranee. “Ah, Fidá, run, run, and bring Neila and
Churi! I fear this man. He must not see you.”</p>

<p>“He has already seen me. I cannot go.”</p>

<p>This much they had time to say, as the Rajah’s counsellor
came slowly toward them, his arms folded across
his breast, his eyes aflame with angry suspicion.
Ahalya, trembling though she was, still straightened
up to receive him, and Fidá fell slightly behind
her, to one side, as became a slave. But there was,
in his attitude, small suggestion of respect for him
who approached. At a little distance Ragunáth
halted and looked at them:—looked as only he could
look, from one to the other and back again. To-day,
however, his lips did not smile, but wore the hard
line of jealousy. Under this gaze Ahalya quivered
anew; and Fidá heard her catch her breath. Instinctively
he stepped forward. But, just at that moment,
Ragunáth raised his upper lip a little off his teeth,
and spoke:</p>

<p>“The Lady Ahalya has found a new slave.”</p>

<p>Ahalya turned white, but remained silent. Fidá
gazed steadily and scornfully at the eavesdropper,
who, after waiting a moment, said again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“Is there a new law of the Lord Rajah’s, that his
slaves shall walk with his women—picking poppies,
in the fields?”</p>

<p>Ahalya, angered beyond her dread, opened her lips
to speak; but Fidá was before her.</p>

<p>“The Lady Ahalya, attended by Churi, and Neila,
her woman, came to this field to gather poppies. I,
unknowing, was here before her. When the Lady
Ahalya perceived me, she allowed me to pluck the
flowers for her and to lay them at her feet.”</p>

<p>“Churi and the woman, then,—am I blinded? I do
not see them here,” and he peered about the field like
a man looking for a lost gem.</p>

<p>Fidá’s hands itched for his throat; but now, suddenly,
Ahalya assumed the height of her position, and,
actually stamping her foot with outraged dignity,
cried: “Does Lord Ragunáth presume—<i>dare</i>—to
doubt my word? I say that Neila and Churi brought
me hither; and, coming here, we found this trusted
slave of my lord, whom I commanded to pluck the
poppies for me. But my Lord Ragunáth—came he
hither also to get flowers to make a rouge for his
face?” The last words she all but spat at him.</p>

<p>Ragunáth was silenced, but very far from being suppressed.
Indeed, the slight lifting of his eyebrows and
the shrugging of his shoulders spoke as words could not
speak; and Fidá was perilously near an outbreak. At
this juncture, however, by intervention of a dilatory
providence, Neila, and with her Churi, made their appearance
from the temple. At sight of three figures in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the field where they had thought to find one, or, at
worst, but two, they came hurriedly forward to their
lady, who stood awaiting them in silence. Ragunáth’s
eyes were now fixed upon the face of Churi, who endured
the look very well; for in his own way he was
much interested in the situation. No words passed till
Ahalya, indicating her slaves with a gesture, said
icily: “Attend me.” And then, without looking again
at the minister, but with the barest, fleeting glance at
Fidá, she moved away toward the road, and was presently
lost to sight among the trees near the ruin.</p>

<p>The Arab and the Hindoo were left alone, face to
face. Fidá’s eyes were fixed unwinkingly on Ragunáth’s.
On the counsellor’s lips a half-smile hovered,
and his expression had in it more of mockery than
anger. When Ahalya was quite out of sight, he spoke,
slowly:</p>

<p>“So—slave. Art thou prepared to greet thy god in
death?”</p>

<p>Now Fidá’s lip curled. “May Allah receive me at
the appointed time,” said he.</p>

<p>“That time is near.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Lord Ragunáth.”</p>

<p>“‘Nay’? ‘Nay’? Knowest thou not that Rai-Khizar-Pál,
hearing of this adventure of thine, will not
leave thee an hour alive?”</p>

<p>“Even that I do not know, Ragunáth. But, were it
true, still, who shall tell the Rajah of the incident of
the day?”</p>

<p>“I, dog, shall tell him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“Am I indeed a dog? Be it so, I am a dog that
speaks. And I am not a thief.—Does thy master
know thy taste in rubies, lord?”</p>

<p>Ragunáth flushed scarlet. “Thou speakest like a
madman!”</p>

<p>“Nay, it is rather thou that art mad. Thou hast
walked on dangerous ground before, thou traitor to
honor; but never so near destruction as now. Hast
thou told thy master of thy visit to the zenana courtyard
on the day of the great sacrifice? Did he despatch
thee to-day to the poppy field? Hath he ever
trusted the honor of his lady in <i>thy</i> hand? Oh, though
thou couldst hush the mouths of all the eunuchs in the
zenana, the story of thy bribes and treachery would be
shouted aloud by every slave in Mandu.—Thus, the
Lord Ragunáth is the madman.—A slave picks poppies
in the field. A slave is near a lady when Ragunáth
would speak with her. The slave has eyes, ears, and a
tongue. Moreover, this slave understands honor, for he
was born a prince. Speak, then, to the Rajah concerning
this day’s incident. It were fitting he should know—”</p>

<p>“Be silent, man!”</p>

<p>“It seems I am become a man!”</p>

<p>“Be silent,—or thou diest.”</p>

<p>Fidá shrugged, but let the threat go. “<i>If</i> I am
silent, then?” he asked.</p>

<p>“If thou art silent, fool,” Ragunáth made an effort,
“if thou art silent, I will let time and thine own folly
betray thee; for it is not fitting that I should soil myself
with the affairs of infidels and slaves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>And this last insult also, though he was obviously in
the position to command, Fidá passed over. Was it
because he knew that, for all his bravado, he was not
himself innocent of treachery to his conqueror?</p>

<small>CHURI</small></h3>
</div>


<p>Fidá had lived in the palace of Mandu for nearly a
month before he had his first glimpse of one of the
most important persons in the lower stratum of its
life, a man with whom he was later to become but too
familiar:—Churi, the eunuch. They beheld each
other first, distantly, in the poppy field. On the evening
of that same day they met again. It was about
sunset, and Fidá was at the well in front of the house
of slaves, washing out certain of the Rajah’s drinking
vessels, when he became aware of a white-robed figure
standing at his side, and, turning, gave a sudden start
to find himself gazing into a pair of eyes one of which
was of a lustrous brown, the other of a pale, greenish
hue. The owner of the eyes smiled slightly; and then
Fidá recalled Ahmed’s description of the doctor, he
whose position ranked next to that of Kasya among the
guardians of the zenana.</p>

<p>“Thou art Churi,” observed Fidá, wondering if the
man had seen him start.</p>

<p>Churi nodded, and took thoughtful survey of the
Mohammedan. During this look Fidá felt, uncomfortably,
that his secret soul had been penetrated by those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
singular eyes. Churi’s words, however, when he spoke
again, were simple enough: “Did Ragunáth trouble
thee to-day?”</p>

<p>Fidá smiled. “Nay. Why dost thou ask?”</p>

<p>“His face boded thee no good when I saw it. He is
a man scrupling not to lie.”</p>

<p>“Have I lived a month in Mandu and know not
that?”</p>

<p>Churi chuckled. “Thou hast no need of help?”
said he.</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Then I will delay thee no longer. Yet remember
that no slave in this palace need have any fear of that
mighty counsellor.”</p>

<p>Fidá shrugged. He felt himself suddenly put upon
the status of a servant who discusses the persons whom
he serves; and, furthermore, Churi’s words seemed to
dispel the secret satisfaction he had felt in having outwitted
Ragunáth that afternoon. Even these thoughts
it is possible that Churi robbed him of; for, as the
latter turned away, the smile was still upon his lips;
nor did it wholly fade as he went back to his quarters,
which were at the other end of the palace, beyond the
zenana wing.</p>

<p>In his own sphere, Churi was a privileged person,
commanding a respect and an interest above that of
Kasya, the incorruptible. Like Kasya, Churi had a
room of his own; though he by no means always occupied
it alone. So great was his skill in medicine and
surgery that he took the place of first official physician<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
in the palace, though he had had many rivals for the
place, and the Rajah was still obliged to employ a corps
of priests who strove, by means of spells and charms,
to prove their methods superior to those of the eunuch
with his herbs, simples, and tourniquets. Churi’s
opponents troubled him little, however. He appreciated
his gift; and generally cared for the sick among the
slaves and eunuchs in his own room. Two of his fellows
had, in spite of his care, recently died there of the
malignant fever so common at this season of the year.
And to-night, having no desire to eat alone, Churi took
his evening meal of millet and ghee with the other
eunuchs in the common room. While he was still there,
chatting with a companion or two, Kasya invaded the
apartment, evidently in search of some one; and, finding
Churi, seized upon him, and drew him back to his own
room, where they could be alone. As they went, Churi
broke silence:</p>

<p>“The young lord was safely found to-day?”</p>

<p>They were out of possible ear-shot before Kasya answered:
“Too safely. He was in the rooms of Ragunáth.
But my lord himself was not there. Kanava had the
child, and I do not understand the alarm. Tell me, didst
thou overtake the Ranee before she reached the ruin?”</p>

<p>During this last question Churi had begun to laugh.
“Oho! I perceive! Mine eyes are enlightened!”</p>

<p>“What sayest thou?”</p>

<p>“Oho! The faithful Kasya walks out with the Ranee.
My lord councillor is disappointed, captures the child,
amuses him in his rooms with toys, spreads the alarm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
that he is lost, brings back the faithful Kasya to the
search, and then goes to join the Ranee in the poppy
field! Oho!”</p>

<p>“Ragunáth! He <i>dared</i>!”</p>

<p>Churi laughed again. “Dared he not? The Lady
Ahalya was in the middle of the poppy field. Neila
and I stood, by command, near the ruin. Then the
councillor appeared. He had come through a path in
the little jungle. At very sight of him the Ranee
fairly fled to us, whereupon we set out again for the
palace. Nor have I seen him since.” Churi stopped
rather abruptly, wondering how this ingenious version
of the truth had ever come out of him. Was it worth
while to add the important details? There was no time
to consider. Kasya was furious.</p>

<p>“This—this, at last, shall go to the King! This
even I cannot countenance from the man—”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, comrade. What hast thou to carry to
the King? Young Bhavani wanders by accident into
Ragunáth’s rooms. My lord himself goes for a walk.
By accident he meets the Ranee Ahalya in the poppy
field. They scarcely speak. She returns home with
her woman and me;—my lord remains there on whatever
business is his. Bah, Kasya! The fool is punished
now. Doubt it not. The Ranee can lash a man with
her eyes, an she will; and Ragunáth was not favored
to-day. I swear that by Lakshmi. A turmoil is never
the result of wisdom. Let it rest, Kasya.”</p>

<p>Churi was committed in good earnest, now. For his
own sake the affair must not go up to the Rajah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“I thought—” Kasya bent his brows, “I feared
the Ranee did not disdain him wholly. If you speak
truth, however—”</p>

<p>Churi shrugged.</p>

<p>“Then let it pass. In time we shall show him that
the Rajah’s will is done in Mandu.” And, with a sigh,
Kasya turned and departed.</p>

<p>Churi’s desire for company had gone, apparently; for
he made no move to return to the common room. For
a few moments he stood in his own doorway, brows
drawn, head bent, meditating. Then he turned inside,
and dropped the hanging across the open space, to prevent
interruption. Stretching himself out on an improvised
but remarkably comfortable divan, he gave
himself up to a more critical consideration of the drama
that had been revealed to him that afternoon. It was
a thing that he had never dreamed of. A day before,
he would not have believed that he could be so calmly
reviewing the situation that evidently existed between
the one thing he cared for in Mandu—Ahalya—and
the Mohammedan captive. If it piqued him
that he had had no knowledge of its beginnings,—he,
to whom every intrigue enacted in the palace during the
last ten years had been an open book,—he could console
himself with the reflection that he was still the only
one that knew of it at all. But he wished especially to
understand himself with regard to Fidá, toward whom,
as yet, he felt no animosity. Fidá, however, continued
to baffle him. He could come to no satisfactory opinion.
His concealment of what he knew from Kasya,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
though it had come about accidentally, gave him little
anxiety; for it was perfectly consistent with his usual
methods: those plots and plans and hopes in which he,
even he, the eunuch, constantly indulged.</p>

<p>Doctor Churi was, in fact, a person out of the ordinary.
He had been the child of a Rajput woman and an
Arab. For his birth, his mother had been put to
death, and he himself, in his babyhood, sold into slavery.
Before he was even aware of the existence of right and
wrong, he had been made a creature apart from ordinary
men. And when he was old enough to understand this,
his soul rose up in revolt. From that time, his whole
nature was warped; and he became an iconoclast in
his every thought. His brain was unquestionably fine.
His talent for medicine was manifested at an early
age, when he tried to poison himself with opium,
and was only saved by the quick skill of the doctor
in whose charge he was still living. Under this man’s
tuition, he gained his knowledge of anatomy and the
power of herbs. At the age of eighteen he was sold
to Rai-Khizar-Pál, his education having trebled his
value. At the time of the transaction, Churi was made
aware of the sum paid for him; and it was then that
his great idea came: which was, by some means to
obtain the equivalent of the amount, and with it buy
himself into liberty.</p>

<p>Since that day, twelve years had passed away. Churi
was thirty years old; and the little hoard of copper
pieces which he had been able to store up, was still
pitiably small. Meantime his heart had grown bitter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
and his mind had taken to winding through tortuous
ways of perception and imagination. He was known
to many evil thoughts, but to few evil practices. And
there was in him a volcanic passion of humanness kept
relentlessly in check, that occasionally betrayed itself
above the surface in some eccentric outburst.</p>

<p>The man led a solitary and loveless existence; yet
as all human things must know some softening of the
heart toward some one, so Churi had, by degrees, come
to feel a strong interest, a more than interest, in the
Ranee Ahalya, the universally beloved. She was very
different from the other women in the zenana; and
Churi had been first attracted to her by the quality
rarest in women: that quality which she had in marked
degree, and he not at all—disinterestedness. Because
she had never had ends to gain, because she curried favor
with none, he gave her the only genuine devotion that
he had ever felt for any one; and, where her interests
were concerned, was accustomed to waive his own.
Perhaps it was this instinct in him that had suggested
the lie to Kasya; and thereby, probably, he saved the life
of Fidá. But it was quite for his own amusement that
Churi now lay on his divan considering the incidents of
the afternoon. All the result of these thoughts was,
that he decided to see something of the Asra in the
near future, and that the Lady Ahalya would perhaps
bear a little watching also.</p>

<p>Fortune favored Churi’s first decision in a very
simple way. Two or three nights later Fidá, who had
not been in the house of slaves for forty-eight hours,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
went there to find his young comrade, Ahmed, lying in
one corner of the porch, uncovered to the evil air of
night, and burning with fever. Another slave, also
Arabian, stood near by, regarding the sick boy helplessly.
When Fidá appeared, Ahmed, who had lain
with closed eyes, heeding nothing, sat up, stretching
out his hands to his master. Fidá took them tenderly
into his own, and was frightened to feel how hot
they were. Wrapping the boy in his cloak, he bent
over him, keeping off the swarm of little flies and insects
that hovered around, and listening with alarm to
the boy’s half-delirious murmurings. Something must
be done. He was not to be left in this state. Surely
even slaves were given help. And as he cast about,
anxiously, for means of assistance, he was addressed
by one Chakra, a soldier, who stood looking into the
veranda:</p>

<p>“If thou couldst bring Churi to the sick boy, he
would not die.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Churi! Where is he?” cried Fidá.</p>

<p>“I will show thee where he lives.”</p>

<p>“Come, then!—Nay, better, I will take the boy to
him.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the physician, squatting comfortably
in the doorway of his own room, perceived a small
group approaching out of the darkness. First came
the soldier, quite subdued by Fidá’s peremptory manner;
and then Fidá himself, with Ahmed in his arms.
Churi got up and went toward them a step or two, peering
with his strange eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“Thou, Chakra?” said he.</p>

<p>“I come with a slave who brings you a boy sick of a
fever.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Churi, recognizing Fidá. “Come into this
room.—Is the boy thy son?” he demanded, sharply, of
the Asra.</p>

<p>“Nay, I have no son,” answered Fidá, calmly. “But
this boy is my friend, who followed me into captivity.
And he is sick. I fear he is very sick.”</p>

<p>They were now inside the room, where two lamps
burned. Fidá laid his burden down in a corner, and
then, as Ahmed clung to him, sat down beside the
boy, who gave a faint moan of satisfaction. The
soldier had already gone; and Churi, after a moment’s
survey of his two self-invited guests, came over and
made a speedy examination. It took little astuteness
to perceive that the boy was dangerously ill, with a
fever that was common enough at that season of the
year. When he was assured of its nature, Churi turned
to Fidá, saying:</p>

<p>“Let him remain here. I will care for him. But it
is not well that thou shouldst also stay. Go, then, and
fear not.”</p>

<p>Fidá made two or three attempts to release himself
from the boy’s hold, Churi watching him. Then Fidá
shook his head. “He will not suffer me to leave him.”</p>

<p>“I will do it. See.” Churi placed himself immediately
in front of the Asra, and laid his hands, with
great gentleness, where those of the Mohammedan had
been. Ahmed, drowsy with fever, did not notice the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
change. “Now go, softly,” commanded Churi, in a
whisper, and Fidá obeyed.</p>

<p>Such was the beginning of Ahmed’s sickness. It
endured for more than five weeks, and, but for Churi’s
unceasing care and skill, had lasted scarcely three
days. It was, moreover, the beginning of an intimacy
between the eunuch and Fidá, which developed with a
rapidity and a completeness that surprised them both.
During the first few days, when the danger was
extreme, no one was allowed to see the sick boy. But
after that Fidá was admitted regularly; and, first for
the sake of Ahmed, then on his own account, he spent
three quarters of his spare time in the sick room.
Churi having a private interest in Fidá, he succeeded
in making himself so interesting that the slave, though
suffering doubly from captivity and from hopeless love,
was drawn out of himself by the strength of the other’s
personality.</p>

<p>Ahmed’s convalescence was a fruitful period. Churi
had returned to the regular zenana duties, modified
when there were any sick whom he must attend; and
so the hours in which he saw the captive were much
fewer, but thereby more prized. Churi early disclosed
the fact that he had Arabian blood in his veins; and
Fidá, in a passion of yearning for his people, made this
almost a symbol of brotherhood, and poured out to his
new-found confidant all his life-story, with its fury of
battle and its dulness of peace. Churi studied the
young man keenly; for just at this time pressure was
being brought to bear on him from another quarter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
and amazing possibilities began to shape themselves
in his imagination. Ahalya, chafing with impatience,
longing, and bitterness, in her pretty prison-house, had
become imprudent, and told him half of what he already
knew.</p>

<p>Churi had high responsibilities when he served the
zenana. His duties during the day were light enough;
but by night, his was the task to fasten every door
and window looking out upon the unguarded court
of the zenana; and his night-watch at the inner
entrance, in the antechamber connecting the women’s
wing with the palace, was between the hours of twelve
and two. Here was the trust which he had never
betrayed. And here, also, were possibilities which he
had never considered. The problem was before him
now, however; for his feeling for Fidá grew daily
stronger. He was beginning to consider things
which, had they been suspected by a single soul in
Mandu, would have sent him, and with him Fidá, on
the quickest road to death.</p>

<p>Meantime, weeks had gone by. The autumn rains
were at hand, and it was more than a month since the
Rajah’s men had left for the north on Fidá’s behalf.
Daily now their return was looked for; and, with every
twelve hours of delay, Fidá grew more wretched. His
mind was full of fear. It was not at all out of the
nature of his uncle to have murdered the ambassadors
for the money they might have with them, or for any
fancied disrespect in their demeanor. Had this thing
been done, Rai-Khizar-Pál must know it ere long, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
then even the meagre joys of captivity would end for
him. And at this time Fidá did not want to die.
The existence of Ahalya made slavery more than bearable;
for while he lived in the same building with her,
the hope of seeing her again never quite left him. He
loved her. He had told her that he loved her. That
fact never failed to bring exhilaration upon him. Even
the hope of freedom could not reconcile him to the idea
of losing her forever. In his sanguine moments there
flitted through his head the wildest plans:—storming
the palace at the head of an army, bearing her forth in
triumph, and carrying her home with him to Yemen,
where they should live together forever in the house of
his fathers, in the holy city.</p>

<p>But, in time, these dreams were brought to an end by
the return of the messengers from their long journey.
On the night of the twenty-fifth of October, Fidá lay
asleep in the little box of a room that had been made
his own. He had gone to bed early that night, for the
Rajah was hunting in the hills, and his services were
dispensed with. It was nearly midnight when the slave
opened his eyes to find a soldier of the guard standing
over him. He started up, and was presently following
the man stupidly through rooms and passages till they
had come to the audience hall, where the Rajah, dressed
in dusty hunting-garb, sat on his daïs, a frown of
deepest anger on his brow. In front of him were five
men, worn, dishevelled, heavy with sleep. Save for
this little group, the vast room was empty. The
torches flickered, ghost-like, into shadowy corners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
The deep night-stillness was only broken by the rattling
of the soldier’s armor and weapons as he walked.</p>

<p>In his first glance at the scene in the hall Fidá, now
fully awake, recognized the situation. As his guide
stood aside, he walked alone to the foot of the royal
divan, and prostrated himself there, kissing the ground
before him, in the deepest reverence a Moslem can do.
When he had risen again, he lifted his eyes to the conqueror’s
face and found the Rajah regarding him solemnly,
with something like compassion.</p>

<p>“O King, live forever! Thou hast summoned me.”</p>

<p>“I summoned thee, Fidá ibn-Mahmud ibn-Hassan el-Asra,
to hear thine uncle’s message to me. Thou seest
my men are returned.”</p>

<p>Fidá, gone white to the lips, looked into the Rajah’s
eyes, and, albeit his voice was unsteady, said quietly:
“Let them speak.”</p>

<p>“Radai Sriyarman, repeat the message of Omar el-Asra.”</p>

<p>The soldier nearest Fidá turned slightly toward
him, and began, speaking as if by rote: “Omar the
Mohammedan, answering our demand of five thousand
copper pieces,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> specified jewels, and treaty of eternal
peace with Mandu as the price of the freedom of Fidá
el-Asra, spake thus: That what was demanded was
greater than the value of any man. That he would
give, with the permission of the Lord Aybek of Delhi,
the large price of five hundred dirhems for his nephew;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
and, we refusing the offer, he then returned this message
to Rai-Khizar-Pál, Maharaj’ of Mandu: ‘Let the
King beware that he touch not one hair of the head of
Prince Fidá. The sword of the great Prophet is ablaze
over the land, and, in a year’s time, all the country from
Lahore to the great Ghats will be under the rule of the
faithful. Let Fidá, my nephew, be of good heart.
Let him be assured that any injury to him will be
avenged a thousand-fold upon the people of Mandu,
and that the King himself shall answer for his daring
with his life. Thus speaks Omar of the Asra, a
follower of Mohammed, in the name of Allah, the one
God, the compassionate, the merciful.’”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Before the Mohammedan conquest, copper was the standard of
currency in India.</p>

</div>

<p>“Thou hearest it! Thou hearest this message of
thy kinsman?” shouted Rai-Khizar, stirred anew to
wrath with the rehearing of the insolent message.</p>

<p>“Ah! Dost thou not perceive? My uncle desires
my death—longs for my death, that he may know
himself the head of his race!” Fidá cried, in an agony
of bitterness. Then, while the Rajah gazed down upon
him in astonishment, the slave once more fell upon his
face before the conqueror: “O King, live forever! Let
the King show mercy to his slave! Let him remember
how I refused to assume the state of the ransomed when
the messengers left Mandu. Let Rai-Khizar-Pál remember
that I am his slave, defenceless. Let him show
himself more merciful than my own people!”</p>

<p>Fidá pled passionately, scarce knowing why it was
that life had suddenly become so precious to him. To
the surprise of the soldiers, and, perhaps, to his own, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
words served. The Rajah sat silent for some moments,
his pride and anger struggling with his sense of justice.
In the end the good triumphed. His frown softened,
and he rose to his feet, saying:</p>

<p>“Thou shalt live, then, Asra, by my mercy.
Return to thy kennel! But, by Indra, the Mohammedan
hath not yet seen the last of Rai-Khizar-Pál!”</p>

<p>Fidá, scarcely believing in his own deliverance,
scarcely able to grasp the scene that had just passed,
stumbled from the room, and returned to the place that
the King had called his kennel. All that night he
tossed and turned on his uneasy bed, sleeping fitfully,
glad when he woke out of his dreams. Relief at his
scarce-hoped-for escape for a time prevented his facing
the future. But at last he began to realize the fact
that the hope, so slight and so desperately clung to, of
release, was gone: that henceforth he faced a life of
unremitting toil, of thankless servitude. Years—centuries,
perhaps—must elapse before the Mohammedan
rule could spread through Malwa. Nay, India might
rise and drive the invaders back across her cruel mountains
before the prophet’s followers had looked upon
the Dekhan. And as Fidá grimly strangled his new-springing,
infant hope, his cup of misery seemed full.
Despair gripped him; and in its iron arms he slept.</p>

<p>Two days passed before Fidá again visited Ahmed.
There was some excuse for his absence, perhaps, for
he was now become a slave indeed, and had been
given new tasks, one of which might, perhaps, have
been regarded as something of a favor. The charge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
young Bhavani’s horsemanship was placed with him;
and every afternoon, for an hour, he was commanded to
lead the young prince up and down the road beside the
water palace, instructing him as to his seat, the carrying
of weapons, and the management of his animal.
Although the spirit of his new work made Fidá ache
with the memory of his free warrior days, still he was
proud of the confidence reposed in him; and he and the
young prince soon took a fancy for each other. At
first Rai-Khizar-Pál frequently appeared at some period
of the lesson; and, having convinced himself that his
slave was really fitted to instil the knightly spirit into
his son, Fidá found himself restored to a part of his
former favor.</p>

<p>The matter of the riding lessons and the companionship
with Bhavani were not given up while Fidá lived in
Mandu; and, long before he left it, despair over his captivity
had been driven from his heart. For forty-eight
hours after the return of the ambassadors of ransom,
he hugged misery close, and the future was veiled in
black. But on the third day his lonely fortitude gave
way, and, when Bhavani’s lesson was over, he stole
down to the house of eunuchs and into Churi’s
familiar room. Ahmed, convalescent now, lay sound
asleep upon his bed. But upon Fidá’s appearance,
Churi came forth from a shadowy corner, and took him
by the hand.</p>

<p>“Come, let us sit here, Asra,” he said, in a low voice,
at the same time leading his visitor to the place where
he had been sitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Fidá, mildly surprised at his manner, settled himself.
Churi sat down at his side, and stared at him, meditatively,
for some minutes. Then a distorted smile
broke over his face. “I was waiting for thee, prince
of the Asra.”</p>

<p>“I am no prince,” returned Fidá, savagely. “I—”</p>

<p>“Yet,” broke in Churi, “I bring a message to you
from a—princess.” He paused. Fidá sat staring at
him, incredulous of his ears.</p>

<p>“I have a message for Fidá, Prince of the Asra,” repeated
Churi, at length, with emphasis. “Wouldst
hear it?”</p>

<p>“Speak!” answered the slave, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“These, then, are the words I was told to say to
thee: ‘Why comes not the Asra to her that waits?
The way shall be easy to one greatly aspiring’.”
Churi spoke in the lowest voice; and Fidá strained
forward to catch the words.</p>

<p>“‘Why comes he not to her that waits? The way
shall be easy—to one greatly aspiring’,” he repeated,
trying to grasp all that it meant.</p>

<p>“And there was this to be given,” continued Churi,
taking from his girdle, and handing to Fidá, a faded
and wilted poppy.</p>

<p>Fidá grasped the flower in his hand, and started
wildly to his feet. “Take me to her!” cried he.
“Take me to her, Churi! Allah give thee life!”</p>

<p>“Quiet! Quiet! Shall the whole palace hear thee?”
Churi glared at him, without moving from where he
sat. In his face there was no sign of life. And,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
at his words, and still more by the cold indifference
into which his expression had relapsed, Fidá’s flaming
eagerness was chilled. His face grew questioning.
The hand holding the poppy dropped to his side.
Then Churi spoke, slowly:</p>

<p>“I have delivered to thee the message. Find thou
the way.”</p>

<p>“Churi!”</p>

<p>The eunuch smiled, vaguely.</p>

<p>The smile accomplished much. Fidá’s impatience
gave way. Determination took its place. He sat
down again beside his tormentor, placed the poppy
carefully in his own sash, and then leaned persuasively
toward his expressionless companion. “Tell me, Churi,
wherein I am wrong,” he said, sweetly.</p>

<p>Now, Churi had got himself into an anomalous position.
He had, as a matter of fact, accepted a gift from
Ahalya for the transmission of her message; and he was
perfectly well aware that she expected him to go much
farther in the betrayal of his office than she had asked
in words. But Churi was not quite prepared for these
lengths. His actions during the last few moments
had been instinctive. He was trusting to chance to
show him a method of procedure. After some little
thought, he answered Fidá as truthfully as he could.</p>

<p>“Thou’rt wrong in this, Asra, that thou acceptest
this message for truth when it says: ‘the way is easy
to one greatly aspiring’. The way is not easy, but,
rather, so difficult that I see no means of traversing
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Dost thou not, indeed? Ah, but thou aspirest not,
Churi. That is the difference.”</p>

<p>Churi shrugged.</p>

<p>“Now I already see the feat performed. Shall I
explain it to thee?”</p>

<p>“I am a listener, Asra.”</p>

<p>“Then hark. Between the hours of twelve and two,
the zenana is guarded by one that is a kindly man.
At the hour of his watch this fellow, for just the
shadow of an instant, falls asleep. Lo! The way is
open!” Fidá smiled delightedly.</p>

<p>Churi, however, turned on him a solemn look.
“Truly thou hast little regard for the life of the
‘kindly one’. Knowest thou not the penalty for a
guardian that sleeps?”</p>

<p>Once again Fidá sprang to his feet. “Name of
Allah, man, why hast thou brought this message then?
Was it to drive me mad? Am I a fool to be mocked
at? What meanest thou?”</p>

<p>Churi’s color changed perceptibly. “I mock thee
not,” he said, in a voice that rang untrue. “I mock
thee not. Behold, thou demandest of me my safety,
my fidelity, my life. Is that so small a thing to ask—as
a gift?”</p>

<p>“A gift! Ah! I see.” Fidá’s head sank upon
his breast, and, for a moment, he was lost in thought.
Then, looking Churi straight in the eyes, he said: “I
am a slave—thou knowest that. What wilt thou have
of me? Wilt thou take my life when once I have done
the bidding of—the beloved?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Thy life is useless to me.”</p>

<p>“Killing me, thou couldst save thine honor.”</p>

<p>“I am no murderer.”</p>

<p>“Then—wait! Wait.” Fidá’s hand flew to his
sash. He was not treasureless. Nay, at this moment
there was, on his body, a fortune greater than that
asked as his ransom. True, it was worth more to him
than his freedom. He had been willing to suffer slavery
rather than deliver up his race to death. But love!—Ah,
the Asra had always held that greater than life.
Love was beyond price. Should not the Asra ruby
buy him the love that must eventually kill him? Instantly
impulse answered that death, after the love of
Ahalya, would be as nothing. Yet he waited to weigh the
question further; and was met on every hand by reason
flanked with love. What promise did life hold out to
him:—the dry, lonely, lowering life of the slave? At
the end death would come, and the ruby be buried with
him, or pass to the conqueror of the alien race. Let
him, then, buy a great, brief joy with it, and afterwards
a speedy exit from his slavery.</p>

<p>Fidá drew forth the golden box, Churi watching
him with surprise and interest. Pressing the hidden
spring, he let the ruby roll into his palm, and held
it out to Churi.</p>

<p>“Look,” said he. “Take it into thy hand and
look.”</p>

<p>The eunuch complied; and, seeing how the wonderful
stone gleamed and glowed even here in the shadows,
his eyes brightened and his lips twitched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“This is the key to the zenana. Take it, Churi, and
unlock the door for me—to-night.”</p>

<p>Churi looked up into Fidá’s face, and found there
sincerity and earnestness. For a moment he hesitated,
considering, counting the cost. At last his eyes fell.
“How much is this ruby worth?” he asked, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“More than was asked for my ransom.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, didst thou not ransom thyself with it?”</p>

<p>“It holds in it the fate of the Asra. For her, only,
would I surrender it.”</p>

<p>“Hath the Rajah seen it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and suffered it to remain with me for the sake
of my people.”</p>

<p>“How, then, shall I take it from thee?”</p>

<p>“Because I give it—freely.”</p>

<p>Churi’s hand closed slowly on the stone. His eyes
were glittering as he rose at last. “Come, then, to the
antechamber, to-night,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Fidá’s face grew radiant. “Wilt thou tell her?”</p>

<p>“I will tell her.”</p>

<p>“At midnight to-night—oh, my beloved!”</p>

<p>Churi stared at him still. “Truly thou aspirest
greatly,” he said, with envy in his heart.</p>

<small>THE POWER OF THE FLAME</small></h3>
</div>


<p>After his arrangement with Churi, and the delivery
of the ruby, the remaining hours of daylight
passed for Fidá in swift chaos. Ahmed woke before
he could leave the room; and he sat beside the boy
trying to talk to him for a few minutes, though he
had little notion of what he was saying. Then he
returned to his duties beside the Rajah, and for the
next three hours was fully occupied, though his mind
wandered far from his hands, and he drifted through
mists of thought. It was not till later that there came
an idea that filled him with terror. Might not the
King himself guard the zenana to-night? Happily this
dread was of short duration. The King sat late over
his wine with Manava; and Fidá himself saw him
in bed and beyond apprehension. Then, at last alone,
Fidá betook himself to his diminutive room, and there
prepared to wait through two eternal hours.</p>

<p>How long the time was; and how short! He would
not look back; he dared not look forward. He existed
only in a consciousness that she, she, the one, was waiting
for him; that to-night, at last, he should be alone with
her, fearing no intrusion. This unexpressed thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
he had lived with all day; and it became keener, now,
till he could not be still. It grew late. The palace
was quiet; but Fidá was beyond passiveness. He
rose, walked swiftly through the maze of rooms and
passages, and entered the silent courtyard. The moon,
a little past the full, had come up from the east, and
swung, like a great, yellow lantern, above the dark
outlines of the palace roof. The world shone softly in
the mellow light. The night air from the hills was
cold; but the earth was sweet. Fidá loitered near a
doorway, wrapped in his cloak. The great courtyard
was empty save for the two motionless soldiers
that guarded its entrance. Apparently not another
soul was abroad in the palace to-night. Fidá moved
languidly across and looked into the temple room of
Vishnu. Darkness and silence here. The gods also
slept. A great excitement, a great terror, a high
ecstasy were drawing over him. Surely now it was time—time
to claim the price of the ruby. Surely by this
time Churi stood on guard in the antechamber. Yet
nothing must be risked. If he were too early?—The
thought was impossible. He waited, therefore, till the
moon was halfway to mid-heaven, and then, when he
could endure no more, left the outer world. A moment
later he stood at the door of the antechamber.</p>

<p>“Is it thou?” came, in the faintest breath, from
Churi, within.</p>

<p>In an instant Fidá was at his side, and had seized
him by the arm. “Now! Now!” said he, gazing
fiercely, eagerly, into the eunuch’s unmatched eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“Enter then, and turn to the left hand. The way
is short. It is not to be missed.”</p>

<p>Fidá grasped Churi by the shoulders, clasped him
for a second like a madman, and then ran across the
forbidden threshold—where man not of the royal
house of Mandu had never set foot before. Swiftly
he traversed the short, dark passage opening on his
left, and presently found himself in an oblong room,
lighted by a single crimson lamp that glowed through
a mist of incense smoke pouring up from a metal jar
on a stand, near by. Dazed by the overpowering sweetness,
he shut his eyes for an instant. When he opened
them again, he had a swift impression of rich tapestries,
thick rugs, many cushions, and then—and then
he beheld, lying on a divan at the end of the room, a
slight figure, all clad in red and gold, lying asleep in
the heavy air.</p>

<p>His heart pounded against his sides. His throat
tightened till he could have uttered no sound; and he
went to her, softly, and knelt at her side, and gazed at
her. She was here—waiting for him. Her white
lids were shut over her eyes, and the long, silky lashes
curved outward a little from her cheek. Her heavy
hair was pushed back from her brows; and one of her
little hands lay in a mass of it above her head. Fidá
studied her, hungrily, eagerly, silently. He had never
seen her like this before—had, indeed, never dreamed
of seeing her so. She was his, for his eyes to feast on.
And oh—how fair! how fair! In that moment he
dreaded to have her wake; for then she would surely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
send him from her. It seemed to him impossible that
she could love him, could suffer him to kneel beside her.
Yet, with an effort, after two attempts, he whispered
her name, hoarsely: “Ahalya!” Then again, after a
moment, “Ahalya!”</p>

<p>She sighed, and her eyes opened. Shivering slightly,
she stared, and sat up, crying: “Thou art come! Ah,
thou art come at last!”</p>

<p>That was all. It was more than mortal flesh could
bear. He had touched, he had clasped her. She was
lying in his arms.</p>

<p>Nearly two hours went by; and then Neila appeared
from an inner room. Ahalya was still upon the divan,
her head pillowed on the breast of Fidá, who sat
upright. It seemed almost as if they slept, so motionless
they were. Neila halted in the doorway, staring
at them, till she encountered the glittering eyes of the
Asra.</p>

<p>“Oh, thou must go! It is time,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“No!” Ahalya, feeling the intruding presence,
roused herself, and convulsively tightened the clasp of
her arms about Fidá’s neck.</p>

<p>“Krishna!” mourned Neila, “we shall all be
killed!”</p>

<p>Fidá, however, conquered himself, and loosened the
Ranee’s arms. “Beloved, I must go—that I may
return,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Trembling, Ahalya submitted; and, as Fidá rose,
she sank upon the divan, face downward, nor could any
intreaty induce her to lift her head again. So they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
parted, without a word; and, at the zenana door, Fidá
found Churi, excited and uneasy. He hailed the Asra’s
appearance with infinite relief.</p>

<p>“Mahendra will be here in a breath. I had nearly
come for thee.”</p>

<p>Fidá smiled at him out of shining eyes. “Ah,
Churi, had I a thousand rubies, they should all be
thine!”</p>

<p>“Thou fool!” rose to Churi’s lips. But he only
said: “Verily, the danger is worth rubies, even of the
value of thine. Is this thing to be done again?”</p>

<p>“Again and yet again! until—” Fidá’s face
darkened, “until I pay my price—of death.”</p>

<p>But Fidá as yet was far from death. Overcome
with weariness he returned to his bed, and slept for
nearly six hours before he woke to the new joy of light
and living. That day he was as a man drunk. His
exhilaration was boundless. He walked upon air.
His eyes shone, his voice rang triumphant with love.
The world was at its climax. She was his. What
mattered dishonor? What mattered treachery, slavery,
or the old, forgotten curse? Love, youth, the world,
were his. Should he ask more?</p>

<p>With the evening came his answer. With all this,
he had still little enough; for the King ruled in his
zenana, and Fidá began to know something of the
sinner’s suffering. She was beyond the protection of
him to whom by right of soul she belonged. She was
beyond him; and yet, second by second, he must suffer
for and with her. He wept and raved and clenched his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
shaking hands in the madness of jealousy at this retribution
of the wrong he had done. In the new day, as he
came to gaze upon the tranquil face of his conqueror,
his whole being was stirred with wonder that such
things as were in his heart could lie there unsuspected.
But Rai-Khizar-Pál could not know the heart of his
slave, nor how, with night, hope came again.</p>

<p>As soon as Churi went on guard at midnight, Fidá
appeared in the antechamber, unstrung and reckless.
He would have rushed past the eunuch without a
word, but that he was forcibly restrained. This action,
on the part of his one ally, goaded Fidá fairly to madness;
and, without speaking, he flung himself into a
fierce struggle with the eunuch, whose strength, however,
he presently discovered to be very great. When
both of them were all but exhausted, the Asra, coming
to himself, fell back, staring hopelessly at his opponent,
and murmuring, more to himself than to Churi:</p>

<p>“Thou traitor! Oh, miserable! Have I sold my
birthright for this!”</p>

<p>“Madman!” retorted Churi, “thinkest thou there
is no reason in what I do? I serve our lady. She
bade me deny thee entrance.”</p>

<p>“It is not true!”</p>

<p>“By Krishna, I swear it.”</p>

<p>“Ahalya!” Fidá’s face grew deathlike.</p>

<p>“Neila came to me at dusk. The Ranee is sick and
shaken with grief and fear. Thou canst not see her—yet.”</p>

<p>“<i>Yet!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>Churi smiled cynically. “Thou boy! Verily thou
knowest little of women. Wait in patience, Asra.
I think thou shalt see her again. I will not prevent
thee. But now, leave this place, if you court not
death.”</p>

<p>Without further words, Fidá turned and left the
room. When he reached his bed again, he flung himself
upon it, and lay for a long time staring into the
dark. Then, gradually, he fell to weeping; and while
he wept, Allah had pity on his weakness, and sent him
sleep.</p>

<p>But Ahalya! Poor Ahalya! While her lover’s
heart accused her of all faithlessness, she suffered not
one whit less than he. She loved Fidá, indeed, wholly.
Their meeting had been of her own desire and arrangement.
But she was young in intrigue, new to dishonor.
And when solitude brought her face to face
with what she had done, she was plunged into despair.
Her mind distorted all things. Fidá seemed infinitely
remote from her. Their love had been a thing of such
magical growth that, having been half the time unconscious
of the workings of her own senses, she, in the
first reaction, began to disbelieve altogether in her
love. She was in a labyrinth of warped emotion,
shame, and remorse; and, till she found herself again,
the very name of Fidá was abhorrent to her.</p>

<p>All through the day that followed their first meeting
the Ranee lay on her bed, wide-eyed, tearless, and
unapproachable. Neila wondered and watched, but
dared not intrude upon her. On the evening of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
day came Rai-Khizar-Pál, all unconsciously bringing
her punishment for her sin. For two days after
this she remained in seclusion, while Neila and
Churi vainly took counsel together on behalf of the
slave, for whom each felt some sort of unselfish concern.
But, though Fidá was on the verge of madness,
not a word could be got out of Ahalya concerning him:
not one message would she send. Churi began to
doubt his theory of the fallibility of women; and Neila
would not have been surprised at a full confession of
everything to Rai-Khizar-Pál. But at last, miraculously,
came an incident from an unexpected quarter
that did what no amount of pleading and persuasion
could have accomplished.</p>

<p>In the hidden drama that had, in the past few days,
been enacted in Mandu, there was a certain personage,
long since accustomed to play an important rôle in
every game of intrigue, who had had no part at all.
Nevertheless, Lord Ragunáth was not going to be discounted
forever; and it was at this stage of events that
he appeared upon the scene. Perhaps a scent of hidden
things was in the air. Perhaps his sensibilities,
attuned to all that was secret, caught some vibration
of treachery; though the nature of that treachery remained
undreamed-of. At any rate, it was just at the
time when the object of his furtive desires was torn and
riven with a struggle in which he was not concerned,
that Ragunáth suffered one of his periodic fits of madness,
and hit upon a new and, at last, successful
method of gaining one of his ends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>The two eunuchs who had recently died of fever in
the palace had been men of experience and importance in
their station; and they had been replaced by two others,
supposedly responsible, from Bágh. Kasya had satisfied
himself that both were trustworthy; but Kanava,
sounding them from another quarter, found in one of
them a long-sought weakness. On the afternoon of the
fourth day of Fidá’s misery, when the Rajah was attending
ceremonial in the village at the other end of
the plateau, one of these men, Kripa by name, stood on
guard in the zenana antechamber. Kripa was tired,
and Kripa was bored with the prospect of two stifling
hours of solitary watching. He was, then, undisposed
to be short with any one that came to break his dull
thoughts. And when Lord Ragunáth unexpectedly
appeared before him, he greeted the minister with a
mixture of curiosity and reverence that Ragunáth
found propitious to his purpose. He had come well
prepared and fortified with the corrupter of prudence,
the breaker of faith, the power of the evil-minded—a
goodly sum of money. For a few moments he applied
himself to his task with all his considerable mind and
tact; and, at the end of that time, Kripa stood before
him a newly enlisted mercenary. It had been
arranged between them that Ragunáth was to stay
in the anteroom and there have a brief interview
with the Lady of his Desire; provided of course that,
what he did not for a moment doubt, she would see
him.</p>

<p>Quite tremulous with eagerness, Ragunáth pushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
his minion into the zenana, bearing a blind message
to the Lady Ahalya to come at once, if it were her
pleasure, to the antechamber. Kripa reappeared in
a very short space of time, smiling the word that
the Ranee would follow him. And Ragunáth, drunk
with high success, commanded the fallen one to remain
away for at least an hour. Promising nothing, but
very well satisfied to be free for a little while, though
he dared not join his companions, Kripa, drowsy with
the dusk and quiet of his watch, wandered off into the
maze of rooms around the audience hall, lay down upon
a convenient divan, and was shortly sound asleep.</p>

<p>Ragunáth, meantime, had grown as nervous and eager
as a youth while he waited the coming of the Ranee.
She did not keep him long. As he stood watching the
curtained doorway, she appeared, her young face pale
and strained, but with expectation in it; her form all
swathed in crimson silks. At sight of her, Ragunáth
gave a low cry of emotion; but, in the same instant,
Ahalya’s face changed utterly.</p>

<p>“Thou!” she said, half wondering, half sobbing.</p>

<p>“I, rose of heaven! I, star among women, whose
hair holds the fragrance of the jessamine, whose
breath is perfumed like the almond blossom. I, I,
Ragunáth, have sought thee, and beseech thy favor;
for, indeed, I am gone mad for love of thee!” And,
throwing himself before her, Ragunáth lifted the filmy
hem of her garment to his lips.</p>

<p>Ahalya still stood in the doorway, clinging to the
curtains on either side of her, her face expressing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
mixture of repulsion and disappointment. As Ragunáth
would have clasped her feet, she drew back,
sharply:</p>

<p>“Away from me, dishonorable one!” she said, in a
low, angry voice. “If you would not have me expose
this treachery to Rai-Khizar-Pál,—begone!”</p>

<p>Ragunáth did not rise. Rather, he lay writhing
at her feet, like one possessed of a frenzy—as indeed
he was. But it was a resolving frenzy. After the
period of madness, he was coming to himself again.
Pride returned to him, and, with it, something of his
usual cunning, as he remembered how willing Ahalya
had been to come before him. It was then that he got
to his feet; then that he turned on the woman, asking,
softly, through shame of the display he had made:</p>

<p>“O, Ranee, it was not I, then, that you came to
greet? It was not for Ragunáth that you are decked
out in crimson and gold? And for whom? for whom?
Not Rai-Khizar. He waits not in antechambers for
thy greeting. Ah, will it be wise, Ranee, to ‘expose’
me to thy lord? There are things—”</p>

<p>“Be still! thou shameless, treacherous, hateful one!
I hate you! Know that. I hate—I hate—I hate
you!” And, her voice on the last word rising to a shrill
cry, the young woman, white faced and burning eyed,
turned from him and fled into the inaccessible rooms
beyond. There, panting, sobbing, angry, and, in her
heart of hearts, greatly terrified, she flung herself upon
a couch and gave herself up unreservedly to acknowledgment
of her hidden love and woe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>Now, during the few moments of this interview,
Neila, astonished and frightened at what she, like
Ahalya, believed to be Fidá’s appearance at this hour,
had, as soon as her mistress left her, run to seek out
Churi, whom she brought back more disturbed than she,
just as the Ranee returned to her rooms. Churi did
not enter there, but proceeded at once to the antechamber.
Parting the curtains that hung before the
door, he started, and stood stock-still to find himself
face to face with the one man he had had no thought
of. Ragunáth was still standing where Ahalya had left
him, and, at this new appearance, he was too much
taken aback to note the newcomer’s discomposure.</p>

<p>“Churi!” he muttered, half in alarm, half angrily.</p>

<p>“Even so, Lord Ragunáth.” At once Churi was
himself again.</p>

<p>“Dog! who sent thee here?”</p>

<p>“The Puissant One speaks the same words that had
lain on my humble lips.”</p>

<p>“Strangely indeed is the King’s zenana conducted!
I pass the antechamber and see no guard therein. I
enter the antechamber that I may see if the guard be
perhaps concealed from view; and, as I look, there
appears a pariah, who sees fit to insult me. By Indra,
thou doctor of dogs, thou shalt be whipped for it!”</p>

<p>There came a little pause, during which Churi, with
his disturbing eyes, gazed steadily, smoothly, quietly
upon the man that faced him, till Ragunáth fairly
writhed under the look. Then Churi said: “It
pleases the high lord to speak these words. Since it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
pleases him, it is well. But,” and the tone changed,
“let him take care that he act not as he speaks. There
are things more strange than unguarded antechambers
that may come to the ears of the Rajah.” Churi’s eyes
menaced now.</p>

<p>Ragunáth gave some sort of hoarse ejaculation; and
then, after wavering for a moment, he turned and
walked swiftly away, nor halted till he was safe in his
own rooms, with a personal slave or two on whom to
wreak his wrath and his double mortification.</p>

<p>Churi, left alone, was well pleased with himself.
Luckily the self-satisfaction was not too great to prevent
his having his wits still about him. He knew
that this was Kripa’s watch, and in three minutes he
had hunted out the deserter’s retreat, kicked him
awake, and despatched him to his post thoroughly
frightened. Yet Kripa was allowed to remain in possession
of his gold; for Churi was in no position to
expose the acts of the man he hated.</p>

<p>Unlucky as it had already proved to its two principal
actors, the little drama of the afternoon had further
results. Ahalya, even in the anger of revulsion against
Ragunáth, knew that there was another feeling in her
heart: dared, after a time, admit to herself her disappointment
that it had not been Fidá who thus boldly
summoned her to him; for indeed she had gone to the
anteroom, on Kripa’s summons, thinking to find her
lover there. Before nightfall she knew that she longed
to see Fidá again; and the more she repudiated the
thought, the more insistent it became, until she yielded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
to it. In the early darkness Churi was despatched to
bid him come to her that night.</p>

<p>When Churi managed to waylay the slave, Fidá was
on his way to the rooms where wine was stored, to fill
a jar for his lord’s evening meal. It needed only a
look between the two for the eunuch’s errand to be
understood. Fidá laid a hand on Churi’s arm, and said,
softly: “In the name of Allah, Churi, speak to me!”</p>

<p>“There is no need,” answered the other, looking at
him in a quizzical but not unkindly manner.</p>

<p>“She will see me? I shall go to her again?”</p>

<p>“To-night. As before.”</p>

<p>In a single instant the accumulated anger and anguish
of the past four days melted and ran away from the
youth’s heart. His load of unhappiness was lifted.
Once more he walked on air. It seemed to him that he
radiated life. But the few hours that still separated
them brought him much that was new in the way of
thought. Since she had forgiven him, he perceived
that his banishment had been, in large measure, brought
on by himself. He had not sufficiently considered her,
her woman’s delicacy and hesitation. He had acted as
his youth and his manhood prompted him. But he
resolved that there should be no such mistake again.
The thought of her now brought a deep tenderness,
which, indeed, might have surprised Ahalya could she
have read it. Nor were the six hours of the evening
long or heavy. He had a foundation on which to
build his castle of dreams; and his heart was full of
thankfulness and relief. It was five minutes after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
midnight when he entered the little room where Churi
stood.</p>

<p>“All is well?” asked Fidá, his mouth dry.</p>

<p>“All is well. No one is stirring. Enter.”</p>

<p>Fidá’s bright eyes grew brighter still; and he ran
boyishly through the doorway into the little passage
where, this time, Neila awaited him. He followed her,
in silence, down the short hall, through the memorable
room at the end of it, which was empty to-night, and
across the next one, that he had never seen, to a door
at which Neila knocked. A moment’s suspense, and
then a muffled voice said, “Open!” The maid pushed
it, and motioned to Fidá, who passed swiftly within.
The door closed behind him. He was gazing upon
the figure of Ahalya, who stood a few feet away, looking
at him, doubtfully, longingly, half sadly. His
heart throbbed with many emotions. He took a hesitating
step or two toward her, pleading with his eyes.
Then, all at once, there was a quick, low cry, and
Ahalya had flung herself into his arms.</p>

<p>What passed between them now were difficult to
relate. Afterwards they themselves had but a confused
idea. It was very certain that Ahalya loved
him; for she delivered herself up entirely to his will.
Yet, with each of them, passion was mingled with something
better: a deep tenderness, a high companionship,
the mutual compassion of the unhappy. She laid upon
him a great responsibility, telling him over and over
again that without him she should not try to live; explaining
the torture of her self-hatred: the shame that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
loving him, she must still submit to another; wetting
his eyes with her tears while she demanded from him
a solution of her miserable problem. Pitying while
he loved, Fidá read what her warped life had been,
and all the history of her loneliness. Nor did he fail
her in a certain sort of comfort, of a philosophical
nature, for which she cared little, save that it came
from his lips. But she listened eagerly to all that
he told her of himself, of his country and his life;
though he withheld the story of the curse, of which,
at their first meeting, he had given her a suggestion
that she seemed to have forgotten. They talked long,
but the talk was finally hushed. Fidá extinguished
the single lamp that burned. And later, Neila, come
to warn them of the time, found them there in the
darkness, Ahalya weeping in his arms.</p>

<p>This time it was the woman that bade her lover leave
her; for Fidá had not the strength to put her from him.
When at last he reached the anteroom, only three or
four minutes before the appearance of Churi’s relief,
the latter’s heart was in his throat, and he was ready to
declare that he would never again run the risk of
disaster and discovery through the slave’s rashness.
Later in the night he sought Fidá in his own room, and
the two had a long talk together. The eunuch had
come with the purpose of protesting against the present
arrangement, with which he was in a high state of
dissatisfaction. But he ended by allowing himself to be,
to some extent, overpowered by the earnestness and the
logic of love; though after he had departed, Fidá lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
awake for a long time, anxiously considering the risks
that he ran in placing all his dependence on this one
person, whom he knew very well to be in some ways
entirely unreliable.</p>

<p>Churi, indeed, was playing a part very different from
the one he had imagined for himself. He had entered
upon the affair rather blindly, and with the belief that a
few weeks, perhaps days even, would convert his ruby
into money; upon which his freedom would quickly
follow. A little time had shown him his mistake.
The ruby was not a gem easily to be sold; for the
simple reason that no one in Mandu save the Rajah
himself was wealthy enough to buy it; and Rai-Khizar-Pál
knew the stone, and to whom it belonged. Questions
were not to be risked. Churi soon realized that he
must wait until the spring, when the travelling merchants
from Rajputana would come down from the
north with the rich wares that made their arduous
journeys profitable. One of these, the eunuch knew
very well, would take his stone, without questions.
Meantime, what was his course to be? It was true
that he was genuinely attached to Ahalya, and had
some feeling for Fidá. Moreover, his natural talent
for intrigue rejoiced at the risk of the present affair.
Nevertheless, that risk, as matters stood at present, was
too great. Soon, then, he found his mind at work
reconstructing, building up new safeguards against
that bombshell which, one day, no caution could keep
from an explosion that must betray its existence to
Mandu in ruin and destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>Churi, evil-thinking, evil-doing, was nevertheless
faithful to his better instincts. It was not for his
own gain that he set his mind to work at new plans of
entrance to the zenana; and at finding therefrom new
exits, to be used in case of need. These plans materialized
well; and, by the bedside of the now almost recovered
Ahmed, he expounded his ideas to Fidá. The Asra
was already aware that the zenana was accessible by
other ways than the central portion of the palace. The
passage from the north wing to the little court was
left unguarded for the simple reason that, by day, no
one could enter there without risk of being seen by
half a hundred eyes; and by night the face of the
zenana itself was made, by means of chains and locks, a
perfectly impenetrable wall, by which the high Lord
Ragunáth himself had more than once been baffled.
For Fidá, however, this difficulty did not exist. On
the other side of that wall there were willing hands to
work for him; for Churi himself had the task of fastening
doors and wooden window-screens at nightfall.
Who was there to discover that one of these, in the
inner room of the Ranee Ahalya, was left unlocked?
Who was there to note the tiny hinge which deft-handed
Churi substituted for a bolt? Rai-Khizar-Pál
never perceived these things; and, beside him, Neila
was the only soul that entered the Ranee’s bedroom.
Shortly, then, Fidá had ceased to be dependent on
the antechamber for access to his lady; and he and
Churi both wondered how so obvious a means had
slipped their first consideration. But passion soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
began to get the better of the Arabian. His gracelessness
no longer stopped with the night. Hairbrained
were the risks he ran, wild the chances that he
took, though all the time it seemed that he was protected
by a scandalous providence. Churi and Neila
spent days and nights of dread; but Ahalya was as
blind to caution as the Asra; and together they overran
advice or pleadings; and recklessly they laughed with
Fate.</p>

<p>Two months—a little more—went by: to the lovers,
months of ecstasy and despair, of joy inexpressible, and
keenest agony; for love like theirs carries constantly its
own punishment. But the man and the woman were
young, of Oriental blood, the desire for affection in
each rendered abnormal by the restraint to which both
had been subject. Fidá went without sleep and without
food, and yet seemed to suffer no untoward effects
from his nerve-destroying existence. Indeed, so remarkable
was his vitality, so strong his power of recuperation
after the longest service and watchfulness,
that he, and Churi also, began in their minds to scoff at
the Asra curse, and wonder whence the quaint legend
had originated. Ahalya, who had little to do, save in
so far as Rai-Khizar-Pál demanded her companionship,
spent all the hours in which she and Fidá were apart,
in dreaming of their next meeting. Never had she been
so beautiful as now. Every line of weariness and discontent
had disappeared from her face. Her eyes,
under the light of their new knowledge, shone like
stars. Her face took on a new glow of color, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
clear, more pure, more rose-and-white than ever. Her
voice had gained a new and tender richness; and, as she
dreamed over the Persian harp that she loved to play,
Neila used to listen in amazement to the beauty of her
singing. Her increased charm had its penalty, however;
for the Rajah was not slow in perception, and seemed
more and more to delight in her, keeping her at his side
oftener than of old. And the suffering entailed by this
was nearly enough to drive the loveliness away.</p>

<p>Varied as were the duties of Fidá’s life, pleasant, or
dull, or interesting as they might otherwise have been,
he performed all save one apathetically, as so much dull
labor to be got through willy-nilly. Everything in him,
every thought, every wish, was under Ahalya’s sway.
Body and heart and brain she ruled him, as, indeed,
he ruled her. There was now scarcely a suggestion
of remorse or regret in either of them. The lower
natures of both were in the ascendant; and there were
numberless hours when the flesh reigned supreme. In
his saner moments Fidá sometimes paused to analyze
himself, doubtfully, wondering if he could be the Fidá
of Delhi and of Yemen. But during the last month he
was not often sane; and when, with the glare of the
day, other thoughts, truths, reproaches, came to him,
he fought them off, refusing to consider, not daring to
remember, his code.</p>

<p>El-Islam, life to the true Arabian, was, by degrees,
deserting the captive. How should he maintain a religion
that taught moderation in all things, duty to the
master, forbearance from intoxication? Ahalya, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
mother, in her long captivity, had lost her own beautiful
Magian religion, and who had herself been brought up
a Hindoo, had, like many Indian women of station,
taken the god Krishna, lord of beauty, romance, and
love, for her special deity. And some of the pretty
ceremony and graceful superstition of her half-doubtful
beliefs had woven themselves like an evil web
around Fidá’s brain. Often, during their quiet hours,
Ahalya used to sing to her lover parts of the great
Indian Song of Songs—the wooing of Krishna and
Radha. And her voice, and the smooth-flowing poetry
of the words, charmed him into new forgetfulness of
the sterner western creed. The story was well fitted
to their state. As Ahalya sang, he loved to call her
Radha; and if she delighted in him as the incarnation
of her too well worshipped god, her lover saw in it no
sacrilege. But in this way his prayers grew strange
to him; and he became in some sort a pagan, unworthy
of any god.</p>

<p>There was but one pursuit left in which they found
an honest pleasure. Both of them loved the boy,
Bhavani, whom, in different ways, each was instructing
in a primitive code of manhood and chivalry.
The child had taken so strong a fancy to Fidá that
his father, perfectly confident of the Asra’s fitness
for the position, began more and more to surrender
him as cup-bearer in order that he might attend his
son. And Fidá, finding the child truthful, obedient,
and affectionate, took a genuine pride in instructing
him in all that he knew. There were times, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
when the man, brought into close contact with young
innocence and instinctive honor, was drawn to a certain
unavoidable sense of guilt; and this same thing Ahalya
felt, when, in accordance with the young prince’s
wishes, she rehearsed with him, in their old way, the
dramatic epics of ancient Indian heroism and self-sacrifice.
And so much alike had the minds of the
lovers become, that the young Bhavani, imbibing from
each the same often identically expressed principles,
came by degrees to connect the two in his mind; perhaps
even, with a child’s intuition, guessing something
of their position, though unconscious of its sin.</p>

<p>The momentary and fleeting suggestions of remorse
were very slight, however, even with Ahalya. Neila,
who knew all, watched her mistress in perpetual wonder;
for she had changed utterly. She was a gazelle
transformed to a tigress; and the handmaid, who worshipped
her with the worship of a slave for a queen,
now feared her while she loved her, and because she
loved her, also feared. Neila, never told anything in
words, had known all from the first, and from that first
had acted as go-between. In spite of the cynicism of
Fidá, who, after the Mohammedan fashion, trusted no
woman, she had proved faithful to both of them, and
had held the interests of both at heart. For, if Ahalya
were her princess, Fidá was a captive prince, a man
rarely beautiful in form, and, moreover, the very first
that, to her knowledge, had ever succeeded in doing
what he had done. He had risen to great heights in
her eyes; and if Ahalya sometimes called her lover by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
the name of her wooden god, Neila carried the matter
farther yet, and half believed that Fidá was really
more than human.</p>

<p>In this different-wise ten weeks passed, and it came
to be the third Ashtaka<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of Magghar Poh (December).
This sacrifice and festival, begun at noon, was wont to
continue till midnight; and the Rajah, jealous of Brahman
prerogatives, never failed to take a chief place in
such rites. Fidá, an outcast according to Hindoo
codes, was, during this holy ceremony, not allowed on
sacred ground; and he therefore gave himself up to
the propitious time, and spent eight of the twelve
hours at Ahalya’s side. It wanted ten minutes to two
when he left her, by the now usual means of the low
window in her room. Wrapping himself closely in the
long, white cloak of thin woollen stuff that made part
of his winter clothing, he started across the little, dark
courtyard.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> On every eighth day through December and January there is a
special Brahman sacrifice called the “Ashtaka.” (See Grihya-Sutras,
Vol. I, p. 203, M. Müller edit.)</p>

</div>

<p>The noise of the revellers in the great court had
not yet died away; and Fidá debated whether he
dared pass through them on his way to bed. For
the first time in many weeks he was thoroughly exhausted;
and the chilly night air swept over his
parched and burning body with grateful effect. All
at once he felt that he dreaded to be alone because of
the thoughts that might come upon him. Entering
the north wing, he rapidly traversed the narrow passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
leading past Ragunáth’s rooms, turned instinctively
in the usual direction, and presently emerged at the
court, where the ceremonial was over, the fires burning
low, and the soma revellers lying or standing about
in various degrees of intoxication. Near the door of
the audience hall stood a little group of priests and
officials, among whom were the Rajah and Ragunáth.
Not daring to approach these, and giving not more than
a passing thought to the matter, gradually overcome
by vague, chaotic ideas that were rising in his mind,
Fidá went on, out into the road, and along it till he
came to the water palace that stood on the edge of the
plateau, overlooking the south plain, through which
the great Narmáda rushed. Here, in the stillness,
Fidá halted, looking around him. He was beside one
of the smooth water-basins overhung with slender
bamboos and tamarind shrubs, with tangles of lotus-plants
floating, brown and dead, upon its mirror-like
surface. Before him rose the low, level walls of this
charming accident of Indian architecture. On high,
overhead, hung a late moon, wreathed in a feathery
mist of night clouds, and throwing a faint light over
the plain and the distant river. To the right, in the
distance, a long, black, irregular shadow, rose the
giant barrier of the Vindhyas, beyond whose mystic
recesses, far northward, lay distant Delhi, the city of
the slow-conquering race, the people of the captive
now standing here alone with the night. Gradually,
as Fidá looked, a great awe stole upon him. His
body had grown cold with the night chill; but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
mind took no heed of the flesh. A change was upon him.
His chaotic thoughts were shaping themselves. Gradually,
before the vastness, the high dignity of nature, the
ugliness of his last weeks became clear to him, and he
trembled with horror of himself. Slow tears ran down
his cold, set face. He locked his hands together, and
rocked his stiffened body to and fro. A cry was welling
up in the heart of him, standing there in the face of
Allah’s creation: the high-reaching hills, the wide, moonlit
plain. To his overstrained nerves it seemed that they
judged him, in their immense incorruptibleness:—him,
the corrupt. And presently the mountains lifted up
their voices and spake. Plainly to his ears, out of the
dim, black recesses, came low, deep tones, uttering first
his name: “<i>Fidá ibn-Mahmud ibn-Hassan el-Asra</i>,” and
then, after a long pause, the words, old and familiar
to him since childhood, the tradition of his race:</p>

<p>“Cursed be the Asra by Osman: cursed this day
and forevermore any man of them that loveth woman
as I have loved Zenora. Let him die in the first year
of his loving, though from east to west he seek a cure.
And to him that taketh from another a promised wife,
may the curse of Allah the Avenger seek him out till
he be hidden in the depth of Hell. Thus I, Osman,
curse thy race!”</p>

<p>Down from far generations rolled these words into
the ears of the youngest of the Asra, who, hearing
them, uttered a deep cry, and, swaying for a moment
where he stood, presently fell, face down, into the
dead grass beside the pool.</p>

<small>THE CURSE</small></h3>
</div>


<p>The night moved quietly on, the moon dropped westward,
and still Fidá, lying there on the dead kusa grass,
did not stir. From his swoon he had fallen into a
heavy sleep which was unmoved by the slow passing
of the night. The far mountains, oblivious of the
havoc they had wrought upon a human mind, reared
themselves grimly toward the stars, and out of their
fringing forests came now and then the roar of some
king animal, or the melting cry of a night-bird. Little
by little the moon paled and the stars grew dim, and a
white mist rose over the far-flowing river. The cold
breath of dawn was upon the world, and in its inimitable
stillness the slave, wakened perhaps by the throbbing
of his own pulses, opened his eyes dully, and
shivered and then rose and stood staring down into the
pool, struggling to free himself from the bonds of
oblivion and of sleep. When the memory of the past
night opened before him, it was as if he contemplated
the undoing of another man. He made no attempt, he
had no wish, to think or to reflect upon himself. The
dawn was upon him—the sacred hour. Already, in
the east, a pale, clear light had lifted itself upon the
horizon. One or two silent birds—kites—floated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
over the walls of the water palace and began to sink
slowly into the depth of the plain. In the village a
dog howled, an ass brayed. Instinctively the spectator
inclined his ear for the muezzin’s call to prayer. But
there was audible only the flutelike note of the newly
wakened koïl. The east brightened. The clouds
over the Vindhyas grew rosy, and the river mist was
tinged with gold. In the fresh morning air Fidá could
perceive how his brain burned, how his head throbbed.
His body was racked with misery, but there was a great
clearness in his mind:—no searching, no thinking, only
a sudden upliftment and a simple sense of gratitude to
nature for this, her hour. Prayer was not upon his
lips; but at last it lay in his heart:—the great natural
prayer that the first Hindoo, waking on his world two
thousand years before, had felt and could not utter.</p>

<p>The hour was advancing. The line of clouds above
the northeast hills changed from pale pink to a fiery
rose-color that shed a glow over the whole plateau, and
haloed the man who stood, with his white-clothed arms
upraised, drinking in the purity around him. When
at last the sun pushed its edge over the horizon, it was
invisible to Fidá; but he knew, from the gradual disappearance
of the delicate vapors, from the sudden
quieting of the birds, the <i>sense</i> of day, that the mystic
dawn was over. Then, at last, Fidá realized suddenly
that he was faint with weariness and parched
with thirst. Slowly he took his way back to the
palace, thinking not at all, only passively longing for
rest. His walk over, he stopped for a moment at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
well, then went at once to his own room, and, thankfully
remembering that every one would rise late to-day,
threw himself on his bed and sank into another stupor-like
sleep. How long it was before he regained a vague
consciousness, he did not know; but he found two
men standing over him, and one he recognized as the
Rajah. The sight of his face caused Fidá a dull
surprise; but he returned into the stupor without
having uttered a word. After that his rest seemed to
be broken by various dire sensations and many monstrous
dreams. When his eyes opened, he always found
Ahmed, and sometimes Churi, near at hand; and, comforted
by their presence, realizing that, with them,
delirium would be safe, he resigned himself. He
knew that he was very ill. Every one else knew it.
Churi was exerting his utmost skill; though he never
once thought of the ruby. It did not remotely occur
to him to try that as a remedy. Three or four weeks
passed away, and then the fever abated a little, and gradually
it came to be understood that the Rajah’s favorite
slave would live. By degrees his strength, wofully
depleted by the reckless strain he had put upon it for
so long, came back; and by the end of January he made
a feeble appearance again. He soon discovered that
his sickness had not been thought unusual by any one,
since in his ravings he had betrayed the fact that he
had spent a night on the ground near the water palace.
Indeed, it would have been strange if the fever that
lurks in all damp night mists in western India had
not made him a victim of his own imprudence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>This view of the matter brought a great relief to Fidá.
Perhaps, after all, the incident of the curse had been just
the wild dream of a sick man. Perhaps those sinister
words had been spoken by his own heart. Perhaps.—Perhaps.—Perhaps.
But, unnaturally, after Fidá was
up and about again, he did not get well. There were
days when it seemed as if his old-time vitality were
returning to him; but there were many more when he
felt as if, by no possibility, could he bear the weight of
his limbs: when, racked with an inward fever that penetrated
to the very bone, he dragged himself about only
by a superhuman effort. Yet, unspeakably dreading
that time when he must face the end, the slave made
every effort to conceal his illness, forcing himself to
much that seemed impossible for a man in his condition.
One thing only he could not do. He could
not see Ahalya. Now, in the light of their past vital
relationship, he realized that he could no longer attempt
his former rôle. Day and night, it is true, he longed
for her sympathy, her tenderness, the touch of her
gentle hands. But in return for her ministrations he
could give her nothing—nothing but the weary plaints
of a sick man. And so, steeling his heart to loneliness,
he went his way, blindly and dumbly, yet still, after
the pathetic human custom, hoping that life held yet
a few empty years for him.</p>

<p>When, with mid-February, the spring appeared,
Ahalya could no longer bear her unhappiness, and
one evening sent Churi to Fidá, bidding him come to
her. It was a summons that could not be refused; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
in the early darkness, he stole to her rooms by the little
courtyard. Alas! How many, many times had he
come to her thus in highest joy! How differently
to-night he came! In each heart there was dread, and
fear:—in hers that he long since tired of her, in his that
she could no longer care for him. When he appeared
she was alone, standing at the end of the room by her
narrow bed, her face turned to the window through
which he entered. Seeing him, she did not move, but
her eyes grew big with inquiry, and her mouth drooped
a little. Fidá, who could not look upon her without
deep emotion, also stood silent till he could command
his voice. Then he said, gently, but without much
expression:</p>

<p>“Thou hast sent for me. I have come.”</p>

<p>Ahalya’s lip quivered, pitiably; and she lowered her
head, without replying.</p>

<p>Fidá, watching her, moved forward a step or two.
“Ranee—what is thy grief?” he asked, putting her,
by his appellation, infinitely far away.</p>

<p>Ahalya gave a sob that was like a scream, and, flinging
herself face down upon the divan, laughed and wept
hysterically, but still without speaking. Fidá, bewildered,
miserable, yet hoping something that he dared
not voice, knelt at her side and longed to give her comfort;
restraining himself only by a great effort. She
wept as long as she would, and then suddenly ceased,
lifted herself, and turned a burning gaze on him.</p>

<p>“Faithless one,” she said, in a low, monotonous tone:
“thou faithless, infinitely despised! Did I not give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
myself to thee, for thee committing the greatest sin? I
loved thee, and my heart was true, and in thy long sickness
by day and night I prayed to the gods for thee,
vowing that, shouldst thou die, I would follow thee as becomes
a widow; for in all ways I have considered myself
thy true wife. And after thine illness, when I yearned
unspeakably to comfort thee, didst thou come hither?
didst send one word to me, that still live only in the
thought of thee? Oh, tell me,” and her voice rose
passionately, “who is thy new love? What is the
name of her on whom thy traitor kisses fall? O thou
wretched one—” her tone became a long, ungovernable
wail, “O captive—O Fidá—hast thou forgotten
me?”</p>

<p>“For the soul of Allah, Ahalya, do not torture me!
Ahalya, Ahalya—I am true to thee! Look at me!”</p>

<p>Dropping his concealing cloak upon the floor, he
stepped into the glow of light under the hanging-lamp,
the pitiless rays of which fell directly across his emaciated
and deathly face, out of which shone his eyes, glittering
with fever. Ahalya gave a low exclamation, which
he answered. “Yea, look upon my face. It is that of
one that hath not much longer here. I have not told
thee, thou beloved of my soul, of the curse that lies
upon my race. That curse was given me by the
Vindhyas on the last night that we loved. In my heart
I know well that I am doomed. My strength is gone,
and the weakness grows daily greater. Shall I bring
this misery upon thee? Shall I—”</p>

<p>But here he was stopped. Comprehending him at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
last, Ahalya, her eyes shining with new-found peace,
went to him and put her arms about his wasted frame;
and he, feeling no desire to resist, let himself be drawn
down upon the divan, his head pillowed on her breast,
her strong, young arms around him. “Beloved,” she
murmured over him, and Fidá gave himself up to her.
As he lay, passive, motionless, one of his hands wound
in her curling hair, they talked together, scatteringly,
of many things. Both of them understood that their
burning days were forever at an end; that indeed of
the quiet ones there were left not many. But, for the
moment, Fidá could look upon the future without dread;
and Ahalya was under the spell of too great a relief to
face new calamity at once. Both knew, indeed, that
the situation might have been infinitely worse. There
might have come sudden parting:—death for one, for
the other the torture of long waiting. Instead, the
future was to be to them but a golden repetition of
the golden past. And even now their companionship
could be resumed, their love only growing the stronger
as Fidá’s body became weak, since they were now bound
by ties of truth and unselfishness that no misrepresentation
or sorrow or suffering could break.</p>

<p>Thereafter ensued a quiet period of nearly four
weeks. The spring was advanced. The planting was
over, and Mandu abloom. The sun’s rays grew daily
hotter, though as yet there was little discomfort from
heat. It was the time of year when all growing and
living things love and mate; but for Ahalya and Fidá
it was the autumn of love. Their days were filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
misgiving; for, as the inevitable end drew near, both
came to suffer a great anxiety about the manner of
that end.</p>

<p>Nor did the late spring bring joy and peace to
Mandu. With the advent of gay birds from Ceylon,
came also messengers from Dhár, in the north, bringing
word that Omar the Asra, with a Mohammedan
army, had come out of Delhi and was sweeping victoriously
southward on his way to Mandu. To this warning
and covert appeal for aid, Rai-Khizar-Pál could
not but reply by gathering together his fighting men,
and preparing to march. Mandu was in a state of
excitement; but there was no rejoicing that their well-loved
King must prepare to set out on a new campaign.
The ministers that were to be left to rule were unpopular;
for this time Ragunáth was not to accompany
the army, but left co-regent with Manava over the
people. For many days these matters kept all the
plateau in a state of ferment; and there was perhaps
only one person among them all that viewed the proceedings
with apathy. He, indeed, was one to whom
events might have been considered to be most important.
Fidá might not unreasonably have entertained
some idea of being taken upon the expedition in his
position as King’s cup-bearer. But this hope, or fear,
was quickly killed; for Rai-Khizar-Pál valued his slave
too highly to run the risk of losing him by allowing
him to come into actual contact with his own people.
Nor could Oriental flesh and blood have been expected
to withstand such temptation to escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>It was on the twelfth of March that the Rajah, with
his army, was to set out upon his second campaign
against the Mohammedans. On the afternoon of the
eleventh, Fidá was with young Bhavani when the
Rajah summoned him. It had been one of the slave’s
most miserable days. During his morning service he
had taken care to keep himself as much as possible
behind his master; and now he dreaded the interview
extremely. There was, however, nothing for it but to
obey the call; and, resigning Bhavani to his attendants,
he hurried away to the King’s private room, where
he found Manava and Kasya standing one on either
side of the royal divan. At the door Fidá performed
his usual deep salaam, and was motioned to come
forward.</p>

<p>“Enter, Asra. I sent for thee. By the flocks of
heaven, thou’rt sick to-day! Hast no care for thyself,
good slave?”</p>

<p>Fidá smiled, slightly and bitterly. “I have no need
for care. I am in health, O King,” said he.</p>

<p>“Tell me not that any man with visage so deathly is
in health. Thine appearance troubles me, for I repose
great trust in thee, and I dare not depart in fear of thy
death. Speak, Manava,—what thinkest thou of him?”</p>

<p>“He hath the appearance of a man very ill,” answered
the minister, thoughtfully regarding the slave.</p>

<p>“Fidá, for the space of a week keep to thy room, and
let Churi and the priests attend thee and bring thee
back to strength again. Thou must accept so much of
aid, for thy look troubles me sorely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>The Asra threw himself on the floor at the King’s
feet, and once more protested that his looks belied
him, that he was perfectly able to perform his usual
tasks. And the Rajah, whose projects were upset by
the prospect of this slave’s illness, allowed himself to
be persuaded against his own judgment, and proceeded
to the object of the audience.</p>

<p>“Fidá el-Asra, thou hast been in Mandu, in my
service, scarce half a year as yet; but because thou art
of high birth and noble training, I repose confidence in
thee. I cannot take thee with me upon my campaign,
because I should fear to lose thee in the north. But,
in leaving thee behind, I am about to place thee in a
position of great trust. Manava, whom thou seest
standing upon my right hand, is, in my absence, to
be part ruler of Mandu. To Kasya here, my faithful
eunuch, I intrust the guardianship of my women. To
thee I give the last of my treasures, the hope of Mandu:
my son, Bhavani, the flower of my heart; to be taught
and guarded till my return. Thou shalt have full
direction over him, save only in those times when the
Lady Malati, his mother, desires his presence. Already
Bhavani loves thee, Asra; and thy training makes
thee fitted to be his companion and his master in my
absence. For this trust that I repose in thee, give me
thy fealty.”</p>

<p>Deeply touched by a mark of favor so little deserved,
Fidá fell upon his knees and pressed the Rajah’s foot
with his brow. In that moment of abasement he was
very near to confession; and, had it not been for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
presence of the other two, Fidá might, at that moment,
have opened up his heart and told his lord all the story
of his treachery and crime. A moment’s swift reflection,
however, brought with it the remembrance of Ahalya;
and in dread for her the impulse passed away, and he
found himself protesting incoherently his gratitude, his
fidelity, and his sorrow at the departure of the Rajah.
Once more, before he was dismissed, Rai-Khizar-Pál,
noting anew his gaunt and pallid face, expressed some
concern for his health; and then, giving his hand to
his slave’s lips, sent him away. Fidá, his nature
suddenly revolting against himself, sought his room,
flung himself face down upon his bed, and there, in
guilty misery, poured out some sort of inchoate prayer
of remorse.</p>

<p>After an hour or two of meditation and quiet, the
Asra took resolution on a certain matter which he had
been pondering for a long while. Ever since he had
become certain that the curse was actually on him, he
had wondered whether or not Churi had yet disposed
of the ruby. It was Churi’s place to have thought of
the stone for him; and he hated himself for the desire
he had to touch it again. But it had apparently never
occurred to the eunuch to use the blessed jewel as a
remedy; and, as often as the thought came to Fidá, he
put it resolutely from him in shame. By this time,
however, his hunger to gaze upon the charm had grown
great and fierce. He felt an intense desire to live;
and, believing the means of health to be within easiest
reach, what wonder that his temptation came again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
and again? This evening, in view of the new trust,
which he had the strongest desire honorably to keep,
the temptation suddenly overcame him, and, putting
away his pride, perhaps even his self-respect, he went
to seek out the doctor.</p>

<p>Churi was in his own room, eating. Looking up
from his food, he gave Fidá his usual easy salute:</p>

<p>“Vishnu favor thee! I am told that thou’rt to be
given sole charge of the young prince. Truly, Asra,
the King loves thee as well as his wife. Wilt deign
to eat with me?”</p>

<p>Fidá did not respond to the ill-timed raillery. He
stood leaning against the wall, gazing at the eunuch
with so strange an expression that Churi changed his
mood.</p>

<p>“Thou’rt ill to-night,” said he, more gently.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am ill,” answered the Asra, in a low, harsh
tone. “I am dying, Churi.”</p>

<p>“Dying! Why shouldst thou die, lover?”</p>

<p>“Allah! Thou knowest why.”</p>

<p>“Ah! The old legend. Dost really believe—that—”</p>

<p>“Canst thou doubt that I am cursed?”</p>

<p>They remained facing each other, silent, staring.
No further words were necessary. Churi knew very
well now why he had come; but he sat struggling with
himself, for he was disturbed. Nevertheless Fidá’s
ghastly face pled strongly. After a few moments,
during which the slave suffered under his degradation,
Churi rose, walked to the shadowy corner of the room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
bent over for a moment or two, working in the earth
of the floor, and then came back to Fidá with the gold
box in his hand. Fidá, looking into the unmatched
eyes, saw animosity in one and scorn in the other.</p>

<p>“There. Take back thy gift.” Churi held the box
out to him.</p>

<p>To the eunuch’s astonishment, Fidá deliberately
accepted it, rolled the ruby out into his hand, and for a
moment feasted his eyes on it. Then he pressed it to
his breast, shut his eyes, and moved his lips in prayer.
When the prayer ended, he replaced the jewel in its
case, and once more held it out to Churi, who had stood
in silence, watching him.</p>

<p>“I thank thee,” said Fidá, simply.</p>

<p>Churi looked surprised anew. “Wilt thou not keep
it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Ah! Thou thinkest me such a dog?”</p>

<p>“Will that help thee—just the moment of it?”</p>

<p>“I do not know; yet it seems to me that the very
sight of it hath helped me.”</p>

<p>A second time Churi held out the box, this time
voluntarily. “Take it and keep it on thy person for
a week.”</p>

<p>Fidá drew back.</p>

<p>“Nay, I wish it. I trust thee.”</p>

<p>“But it is thine. How hast thou not already sold
it?”</p>

<p>“That is not easy. I dare not show it in Mandu.
But in the month of April will come a man from the
north, a travelling merchant of Rajputana, that comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
each year, bringing with him silks, rugs, gold work, and
gems of the costliest kind. I know him well, and he
will take the ruby and give me my freedom. Therefore
thou seest there is time for thee to recover. Take
the stone at least for the space of a week; and then if
thou art better, thou shalt keep it till the merchant
comes.”</p>

<p>There was only friendliness in Churi’s tone. Fidá’s
simplicity had disarmed him. Seeing that the favor
was done willingly, Fidá accepted it; and, when he
walked away from the eunuch’s house, the little golden
box lay in its old place in his girdle.</p>

<p>Next day, at noon, all Mandu thronged about the
palace and along the old road to witness the departure
of the Rajah and his army. It was indeed a brilliant
pageant that set forth upon the long and dangerous
journey to the north. Fidá, in a throng of slaves,
stood against the south wall of the great courtyard,
and watched the companies form. At high noon Rai-Khizar-Pál,
attended by his two ministers, who walked
one on either side of him, came out of the palace, and
was greeted with tumultuous acclamations by the throng
of soldiers and people. And the Lord of Mandu was
unquestionably worthy of admiration. Never had
Fidá seen him more magnificent. His large, well-proportioned
body was clad in half-armor, of a purely
ornamental type, under which he wore a fine, white
garment heavy with red and silver embroidery. On
his head was a white turban from which rose a black
aigrette fastened with a pin glittering with rubies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
His horse, a magnificent animal, in trappings of black,
red, and silver, with the small double-drum rimmed in
silver placed before his saddle to mark his rank, was
held in waiting. After a few inaudible words with the
regents, and an effective parting from each, he walked
swiftly to his steed, sprang upon it without aid, caught
up his bridle, swept an arm toward his body-guard
which immediately galloped up and surrounded him,
and then, amid the renewed shouts of his people, rode
rapidly out of the courtyard, and began the march.
He was followed by Purán, in more serviceable costume,
surrounded by a group of what might be called
aides; and then by the army itself:—first, two hundred
horse, and then five hundred foot, the whole of
the forces of Mandu. Slowly, line by line, they formed
in the limited space, and wound away after their
leaders, spear-heads and head-pieces flashing in the
sunshine, men and animals alike fresh and vigorous—eager
for what lay before them.</p>

<p>To Fidá, still leaning against the courtyard wall, this
sight of armed and armored men passing out to honorable
combat, was bitter indeed. All the warrior in him
rose and struggled for place in his enfeebled frame.
He was sick with the servility of his life. He loathed
the despicable part he had played. Every soldier that
passed him seemed to him to walk over his heart,
bringing back vivid pictures of what had been, when
the smell of battle was sweet to his nostrils, and the
battle-cry the fairest music his ears could know. Once
he had been a man! Now—now—he would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
answer the question of his conscience. When the hour
was over, when the last foot-soldier had passed out of
the courtyard and was lost in the winding road, he drew
a long, heavy sigh, and moved his eyes. The first thing
they encountered was the figure of Ragunáth, standing
near him, gazing fixedly in the direction of the departed
host; and Fidá saw with wonder the expression on his
face: an expression of deep-seated relief, joy,—nay,
rather, triumph. The Asra stared yet more earnestly,
a sudden apprehension striking home. Was it possible
that, at last, Rai-Khizar-Pál being gone, Ragunáth
meant to taste the well-guarded fruit? Fidá’s lips
shut tight. Was there finally to be an open struggle
between them? Was it to be his happiness once to
perform a real service for the King? Wondering,
hoping, hating, he stood there, nor heeded how he was
grinding the golden box deep into the flesh of his left
side.</p>

<small>ASRA FIGHTS AGAIN</small></h3>
</div>


<p>The departure of the Rajah and his army wrought,
at first, little visible change in the life of the palace at
Mandu. The zenana was a little duller, the ceremonies
less formal, the work of the royal court less arduous;—for
Manava, though a just man, had not his over-lord’s
popularity as a judge. To Fidá, however, the absence
of Rai-Khizar-Pál made a marked difference; and his
life was almost entirely changed. He had a new
sense of freedom; and he saw Ahalya oftener than ever.
Since she was no longer subject to her husband’s will,
both she and Fidá had a much greater feeling of confidence,
but also a greater sense of dishonor than when
he was at hand. The duties of the Asra, meantime,
were light, and less uncertain than they had been.
All the morning, and, indeed, nearly to mid-afternoon,
he was with Bhavani. But when their various tasks and
pursuits were over, the young prince generally elected
to spend the rest of his time in the zenana, where he
was the spoiled pet of twenty or thirty women. In
this way many hours were unquestioningly open for the
slave and Ahalya; but Fidá was shortly made aware
that most of them must be hours of sadness. One week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
from the evening on which he had had his last talk with
Churi, he reappeared in the room of the eunuch, who,
as usual at that hour, was within. The Asra walked
up to him, and silently tendered him the golden box.
Churi looked quickly into his face—and his eyes remained
fixed there.</p>

<p>“The charm—hath not worked?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Fidá, shortly.</p>

<p>“Thou’rt not better?—Thou’rt worse?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But the reason of it?” Churi looked down at the
treasure now lying in his own hand, and a faint smile
stole across his lips. “The charm—is gone?”</p>

<p>“I sold it. I sold the birthright of the Asra. I
have doubly cursed my race. It is fitting, indeed, that
I should expiate the sin by death!”</p>

<p>“Nay, despairing one. We shall cure thee yet. ’Tis
but a lingering fever. I shall try to help thee. There
is a certain draught of herbs—”</p>

<p>Fidá interrupted him with a sort of laugh. “Nay,
Churi, spare thy skill. Fever-draughts will not avail
against the curse of the Saint. There. I thank thy
generosity. I thank thee, also, Churi, for all the rest
thou hast done for me. I tell thee now in the face of
death, that, were all to do over, I would face a thousand
ends for half the glory I have known in her. And all
this, I owe to thee. Had I mine uncle’s riches in addition
to the ruby, they should be thine. And yet—Allah
comfort her when I am gone! That—that,
Churi, makes me suffer. Oh, I talk folly in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
weakness. Heed me not. A peaceful rest to thee!”
And, turning on his heel, Fidá was gone.</p>

<p>Time crept slowly along, and the Asra, absorbed in
his duties and in his increasing weakness, took little
note of the many things that passed about him. Ragunáth,
busied with his share of government, was now
doubly occupied with certain plans and desires of a
private nature. It was a strange thing that Rai-Khizar-Pál
had never seemed to suspect what all the rest of
the palace knew: that Ragunáth was, and for a long
time had been, deeply enamoured of Ahalya, who, six
months before, had been almost at the stage of returning
his affection. But for the past four months, indeed
since the sharp repulse he had met with from the lady
herself, Ragunáth had had the wisdom to make no
attempt to see her. Now, at last, however, the time
seemed favorable for a renewal of his efforts; and the
mere possibility of success roused the man’s long-stifled
passion with unconquerable fierceness. Rai-Khizar
being well out of reach, Ragunáth was now a great
power in the government. Manava he considered
almost unimportant, but pliable. And so did he turn
over matters in his mind, that he finally arrived at a
casual, well-arranged talk with his fellow-minister,
begun about servants in general, and continuing to
Kasya in particular, who was getting old, who would be
well replaced by some younger, more vigorous man:—Kripa,
perhaps? He, Ragunáth, felt that the whole
matter might be adjusted very simply, and would
himself undertake it and its responsibility. Manava<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
listened to him, seemed struck with the idea, considered
it for a little, in his grave, inscrutable way, and then said
some pleasant things to his coadjutor. Nevertheless,
Ragunáth, on retiring, found that his point had not
been gained; found that he had an impression that
Manava considered the whole affair absurd; but was
able to lay his memory on not one single unpleasant word
that the other had spoken. He began then to perceive
that he had underestimated his companion in office.</p>

<p>The failure of his scheme was a serious disappointment,
and proved for a time a check upon his plans.
Review the situation as he would, he could see no point
in Ahalya’s guardianship that had not already been
tried and found invincible. Considerably involved in
other matters, he was forced to leave this, that was
nearest his heart, alone for a little; though her image
was scarcely out of his mind by day or night. And
with all his brain’s ferment, Ragunáth found no hope
of action until, for her own reasons, Chance, the great
goddess, stepped scornfully in, and gave him what no
scheming could have brought about.</p>

<p>Spring was now far along, and March at an end. It
was the time of year when all young things were at
the fulness of their vitality; for in India the late spring,
before the coming of intolerable heat, is the real summer
of the growing world. All nature was filled with
vivid life. Each lightest thread of zephyr carried with
it a shower of golden pollen, blown for floral marriage-beds.
Birds and beasts had long since mated. And by
night the bulbul in the champak bushes sang to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
mate throbbing songs of the children that were coming
to them from the eggs over which she brooded. Lutes
in the hands of poets attuned themselves to the triumph
of love; and, under the universal spell, only Fidá could
not rise to it. On the afternoon of the third of April,
the Arab had been with Ahalya for a moment only,
showing himself too miserable to linger at her side; and
she had sent him sadly away to rest alone, and perhaps
sleep back into a semblance of life. Left to herself,
Ahalya found it impossible to be still. She was young,
and there was no curse on her to keep the summer
from flowing in her veins. Neila was asleep somewhere
in the zenana. She must have some one to speak to;
and, even as she pondered, the young Bhavani bounded
in to her with a fascinating and unwise proposal. Some
slave, he said, had told him that this year, in the water-palace
pool, there was a blossom of blue lotos, the flower
said to be found only in paradise. Would she not go
out with him to see if it were really there? Ahalya
seized on the idea with alacrity. She longed to get
into the living world; and Bhavani was delighted with
her enthusiasm. The Ranee veiled herself, and then,
calling no one to attend them, they hurried into the
little courtyard, out of it into the north wing, and
so across a corner of the great court and into the road
to the water palace. And, as Fate had decreed, Ragunáth,
sitting at council in the great audience chamber,
caught, through its open doorway, one fleeting glimpse
of Ahalya’s veiled figure, recognized it instantly with
the divining eyes of desire, and began to calculate how
soon he should be able to follow her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>Unconscious of the ill-omened gaze, careless of the
recklessness and the indecorum of walking abroad
unattended, Ahalya went on, hand in hand with the
worshipful boy, joyously drinking in the exquisite air
of the late afternoon. The sun almost touched the
river in the west, and the air was suffused with rosy
gold. From the south came a fragrant breeze, laden
with the spicy breath of far Ceylon. There was a
twittering chorus of birds. The trees and shrubs on
every side were clad in foliage in the highest stage of
fresh beauty. The tamarind and the willow vied with
each other in grace. The bamboo was tufted with
palest silver-green. The almond trees had finished
blossoming, and the grass beneath their branches was
strewn with pinkish petals. Here and there was a
lilac shrub, heavy with clusters of pale purple flowers—emblems
of Persia. And in sunny places the grass
was strewn with white and golden gillyflowers, with
occasional starry narcissi and daffodils. The whole
world was abloom, and the air heavy with perfume.</p>

<p>As she proceeded, Ahalya’s languid delight increased
to a species of intoxication. She was bewildered by
the beauty of the world, enchanted by the high, pure
notes of the birds, by the whisper of winds in the trees,
by the heavy hum of drunken bees, by the murmur of
distant, rushing water. Bhavani, a little overcome by
her manner, presently broke away from her to run after
a new-come butterfly; and Ahalya walked on alone to
the water palace. Arrived there, and seeing Bhavani
happily racing away at a little distance, the Ranee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
seated herself beside the pool, almost in the very spot
where, months before, Fidá had stood and listened to
the curse that welled from out the mountains, whose
sides were now swathed in a bluish haze, that grew
gradually golden in the light of the setting sun. Here,
in the shade of the willows and bamboos that overhung
the basin, Ahalya’s mood changed, and her thoughts
were no longer of the joy of the young summer.</p>

<p>She thought on darker things: of the plight in which
she was, of the worse one that was shortly to come to
her. In her love of Fidá Ahalya was now, and, after
the first day, had been, remorseless and surprisingly
careless of discovery. This was all in accordance with
the training of the child-woman, who, though she did
not know it, had loved the Rajah as a daughter only,
and had turned from him to the young Arab with
all the truth and all the womanhood in her. There
could never be for her another like Fidá. And she
knew now that the end of love was very near. She
had been denied its expression for a long time; but
while its object lived she did not care. Now, however,
in the midst of this brilliant scene, she suddenly perceived
how weak, how worn he was. And it was
borne in upon her that the pallor of his face was
the pallor of death. How soon would the end come?
How would it come? Could she show her love
for him in performing the suttee? Would there be
opportunity? or would he be burned, like a dog, on a
handful of sticks, in the city of the dead at the other
end of the plateau, far from her reach? The thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
was too hideous to be maintained; but the shadow of it
darkened over her heart. How was it possible that
such dreadful things could be? How—</p>

<p>She was interrupted in her morbid revery by Bhavani,
who, tired of butterflies, came to drag her round the
pools in search of the blue lily. Ahalya was not now
in the humor for this amusement; and Bhavani became
slightly peremptory in his demands. So, finally, she
released herself from him, and, while he ran on, to the
other side of the building, she, desirous of returning
to her meditation, melancholy though it was, began
slowly to pace up and down the flowery turf. Bhavani
was quite out of sight; and Ahalya herself, her back
toward the road, stood gazing out over the sunset
plain below, when there was a sudden step behind her,
and a voice exclaimed in her ear:</p>

<p>“Can it be that I have found the embodied spirit of
the summer?”</p>

<p>She turned sharply, and found herself face to face
with Ragunáth. Her first impression was one of
disgust at the expression on his face; her first
instinct to escape as quickly as possible from his presence.</p>

<p>“I am not a spirit at all. I have lingered here too
long and must go at once. Your favor, sir. Let me
pass!” She motioned him imperiously out of her way;
but, to her amazement, he only moved as she did, so as
to be always in her path.</p>

<p>He smiled, regarding her half-admiringly, half-respectfully,
but kept his position till, stamping one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
small foot upon the ground, she cried, angrily: “Out
of my path, my Lord Ragunáth!”</p>

<p>“Nay, be not so hurried, Ranee,” he returned,
mildly.</p>

<p>Annoyed by the presumption which his tone belied,
she lifted her eyes and looked him fairly in the face.
A shudder ran through her frame. At last she realized
that he did not intend to let her go: that her wishes
were now of no consequence. Instantly she was alive
to her situation. She looked around her, terrified,
desperate, and perceived, at a little distance along the
wall of the palace young Bhavani, standing quite still,
staring at the figure of the newcomer. Immediately
Ahalya began waving her hand to him:</p>

<p>“Bhavani! Bhavani! Run quickly! Seek thy
master!”</p>

<p>Ragunáth grasped her roughly by the arm. “Silence!”
he cried. And indeed she was silent, for, even
as her tormentor spoke, she saw Bhavani turn and start
like a deer in the direction of the palace. And Ahalya
knew well to whom he would go first of all.</p>

<p>In a measure relieved, understanding that now she
had only to gain time, her wits rose to the situation, and
she turned her face to Ragunáth’s frown, and laughed.
“Art thou so angry that I have sent the boy away?
Wouldst thou have had him stand there gazing at us?
Even Radha despatched her maidens ere she let
Krishna look upon her face unveiled. Hast thou not
heard that tale, my lord?” She smiled on him incomparably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Ragunáth’s reply was a laugh. He, who trusted no
living man, was in an instant thrown off his guard by
a woman’s trembling coquetry. “I have heard the
tale.—What lover hath not? Yet it hath never been
sung to me in the young summer, and by one resembling
Radha as thou dost. Sing to me, then, beautiful
one, of the loves of Radha and Krishna.”</p>

<p>“But I have neither lute nor harp.”</p>

<p>“It matters not. There is no instrument that would
dare accompany thy voice.”</p>

<p>So Ahalya, her heart throbbing with fright, her
whole body quivering with loathing of the man who
walked so closely at her side, began to sing. And as she
sang, the daylight sank from the sky; for the sun had
set, and darkness, most terrible to her plight, was upon
the land. She sang the eleventh Sarga of the great
epic: that of the union of Krishna and Radha, which
she had so often poured into the ears of him she delighted
to call her god. And even now, at the joyous
triumph in the words, her heart was sighing at the
emptiness of her love. This, to the music Vasanta
and the mode Yati, is what she sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Follow, happy Radha, follow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the quiet falling twilight,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">So steadfastly and far—’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“That is true, most beautiful Radha. Let thy fair
feet henceforth follow me through the land of delight,”
murmured Ragunáth, in her ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>Her voice shook as, without replying, she went on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Let us bring thee where the banjulas</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Have spread a roof of crimson</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“‘And thou wilt not deny him,’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>broke in Ragunáth, whispering,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“‘One delight of all thy beauty;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But yield up open-hearted</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His pearl, his prize, his bride!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ahalya shuddered again and was silent, wondering
what evil genius had made her begin that song. She
began to fear, desperately, that Bhavani had not understood:
that she was really left alone, at the mercy of
this man whom she feared as much as she hated. Therefore,
filled with terror at what she had made herself do,
she suddenly determined to attempt escape; and, on the
instant darting from Ragunáth’s side, she started, at the
top of her speed, across the grass, in the direction of
the road. Ragunáth, taken wholly by surprise, stood
for a second staring after her, and then hurried in
pursuit. Unhampered by his garments, and far more
used to swift exercise than she, he overtook her halfway
to the road, and caught her round the waist in an iron
clasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>She gave a faint cry, and, at his touch, strove wildly
to escape it. But Ragunáth was not now in a mood to
let her go. Grasping her yet more firmly, he lifted
her, and, in the starry darkness, carried her across the
open space and into a little copse of champaks and wild
cotton trees at one side of the empty lawn. Here
began a fierce struggle. Ahalya fought like one possessed
of a demon; and Ragunáth was a little aghast
at the strength of her fury. Fearing to hurt her, and
realizing that at this rate her strength could not last,
he devoted himself only to defence and the prevention
of her escape, reserving his force for the time of her
exhaustion. And indeed Ahalya presently found herself
in a sad plight. Her strength would not last
above a minute more. Only one hope was left now;
and that was desperate enough. Lifting her head,
she uttered two piercing screams. And—to Ragunáth’s
consternation—she was answered by a fierce cry, as a
man’s figure dashed through the trees to where they
stood.</p>

<p>Ahalya had only an instant in which to recognize the
gaunt form of Fidá. She caught one view of his face
in the gloom, alight with such fury as she had never
dreamed he possessed. Then the two men were locked
together in mortal struggle.</p>

<p>Broken and weak with the strain and terror of the
last half-hour, horror-stricken at what was happening
now, Ahalya stood like one entranced, watching without
sound or movement the combat going on before her.
She could not, in the darkness, distinguish between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
two forms rolling together on the ground. The men
fought without a sound:—Ragunáth with the strength
of passion, Fidá with a final fury of jealousy and
despair. It lasted only three or four minutes. Then
the woman, who, in her terror, stood rocking her body
back and forward, holding both hands to the sides of
her head as if that helped her to suppress the wild
screams on her lips, saw one figure suddenly rise above
the other, draw a weapon from his girdle and plunge it
once, twice, thrice, into the breast of the other who was
struggling to lift himself from the ground. Instantly,
with a low, gurgling cry, the body fell back. And
Ahalya, peering like a mad-woman into the dusk at the
living man, whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Fidá—Fidá—is it thou?”</p>

<p>And he, who was standing straight and still, his arms
hanging at his sides, answered quietly: “Yes, Ahalya.
I am here. I have killed him.”</p>

<small>THE SONG OF NARMÁDA</small></h3>
</div>


<p>For a long time they stood there, in the stillness
of the night, looking at each other in a kind of
lethargy; while between them, on the ground, lay
the body of Ragunáth, gradually chilling, the blood
from its three wounds still running thinly down into
the pool beside it. Around and over all three of
them myriad fireflies fluttered, like stars of the
under-world, setting a ghastly glow over the ghastly
scene. Fidá’s heart was beating very faintly now.
He was obliged to breathe in little gasps. But he
was not thinking of this. His mind was groping.
He was still in a great darkness when Ahalya came
over to him, walking carefully to avoid the blood,
and laid both hands on his arm.</p>

<p>“Let us go back to the palace,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Fidá shook his head. “I think I shall not go back
to the palace. I think I shall go on,” he answered.</p>

<p>“On! Whither?”</p>

<p>“Up. Up to be judged.”</p>

<p>“Fidá! Beloved! You will come with me.”</p>

<p>But the man was not to be moved by her tone, which
was such a one as is used to a sick child. Possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
Fidá was mad, or very near it; but it was a quiet
madness, and he was sure of his desires.</p>

<p>“Alas, Ahalya, what wrong I have done thee! All
the wickedness that man can accomplish I have accomplished.
Wherefore I am going up before Allah.
But thou must not grieve for me, thou fairest of all
women. Thou knowest well that I was very near
the end. Most beautiful—most sweet—lotos-lidded,
fear not lest I should not take upon my soul the
double crime. Thou shalt be freed from all sin in
the eyes of Allah and Mohammed. It is the last joy
of love that I can perform for thee.”</p>

<p>He spoke in a quiet, solemn tone that frightened
the woman inexpressibly. As he paused, she threw
herself before him, clasping his knees.</p>

<p>“O my lord—O beloved of my heart—thou
Krishna—whither thou goest permit that I go also!
If thou art to appear before thy great god, suffer me
to remain at thy side. Spurn me not for that I am
a woman. Did I not vow to thee long since that,
since thou wast my true husband, I, thy faithful one,
would not suffer thee to die alone, but, performing
the suttee with mine own hand, would accompany
thy spirit to its blest abode? And I swear now by
the faithfulness of Radha, and by Lakshmi and Devi
and the divine Ushas, that, if thou goest forth alone
into the presence of the gods, I will surely follow
thee. Wherefore, thou, who hast loved me well, grant
me a last boon. Let me go forth and die with thee,
that we may be judged together, and, if thou lovest
me still, together endure our punishment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“Consider thy words, Ahalya. Just now thou’rt
not thyself. Return to the palace and dwell there
quietly, and let peace come into thy heart. I absolve
thee from that old vow of love. There is no one
that could suspect thee of this murder. I have done
it; and this my absence will proclaim. Bhavani knows
nothing. He is now with Churi, and thou canst tell
the child what thou wilt. Return, then, to the house
of the Rajah, and forget—and forgive—my sins.”</p>

<p>“Nay! Nay, nay, nay!” It was the first time
that either of their voices had been raised. “I will
not be absolved from my oath! I will not be left alone
to face the terrors of Kutashala Máli! Take me with
thee, else, by mine own hand, I die alone. Oh consider
the sweetness of death together! Consider the terror
of death alone!”</p>

<p>“Again—I plead with thee!”</p>

<p>“No, no. If thou diest, I also will die.”</p>

<p>“But thou knowest, Ahalya, that I cannot live. Thou
knowest that to wait will mean either execution by
torture for the murder of a Brahman-Kshatriya, or a
long and agonizing death through my curse. And I,
coward-like, perhaps, choose here a swifter and more
merciful end. Yet, if thou wilt, I will return with
thee to the palace and wait there for what may come.”</p>

<p>For an instant Ahalya considered. Then she answered:
“Nay, beloved, I will not have thee return to
the palace. Only take me with thee that I may not
die alone.”</p>

<p>“And if I took thee with me? How should we die?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“What was it that thou wouldst have done, going
up alone?”</p>

<p>“I have here the dagger that slew Ragunáth.”</p>

<p>Ahalya shuddered. “Not that! Listen. Thou
knowest that by my people there are certain waters
held sacred to the gods, so that those that die in them
are cleansed of many sins. Such a stream is the broad
Narmáda, which to us is the little Gunga, the promised
sacred flood. Let us, then, under cover of night, go
down to the river and there, in the same moment, die
together—thou in my arms, I in thine.”</p>

<p>Fidá reflected. “How shall we reach the river?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I have heard that there is a way down the rocks of
the plateau at this end. When the plain is reached, it
is an easy walk to the river. By dawn we should be
there if—if only—thou hast the strength.”</p>

<p>“I shall have the strength. Did I not slay this
man?” Fidá’s pride was touched; and perhaps, after
all, just this little, human vanity, decided them. “I
have the strength. But thou, most beautiful, canst
thou endure this long and painful journey now?
Faintest thou not for food? Will my arm be enough
to uphold thee by the way?”</p>

<p>“If I fall, Fidá, thou shalt kill me where I lie and
thyself proceed. Nay, I shall not fail thee. Come.
Let us seek the path down the cliff.”</p>

<p>There was a moment or two of delay while the knife
was plucked from the body of the dead man, and
Ahalya removed a part of her hampering drapery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Then, after one solemn embrace, they started. It was
the time of the month when there was no moon; but
the stars, nowhere in the world more brilliant than
here, shed a faint, steady light over the quiet earth.
The descent of the great cliff was begun at a point
almost immediately behind the water-palace; and they
soon found themselves occupied enough to forget the
tragic circumstances of the journey, as they picked a
fearful and uncertain way from point to point, from
rock to rock, down, through the night, from high Mandu
to the plain. What chance it was that stayed their
destruction, they scarcely knew. But certainly it was
a miracle that, in the first five minutes, they were not
dashed headlong down the whole depth. Fidá’s knees
shook under him. Had it not been for Ahalya, he
would have ended all just here, swiftly. But, with an
effort that he felt to be the final summing up of all his
forces, he went on, the woman following uncomplainingly,
fleetly, silently. It lacked an hour to midnight
when they reached the plain, and, looking back and
up, wondered at what they had accomplished.</p>

<p>Now they threw themselves upon the ground, for a
few moments of necessary recuperation. Ahalya was
drooping with sleep, which Fidá dared not permit her
to indulge. He realized, vaguely, that the unnatural
strength on which he was enduring must break soon;
and by the time it was gone, they must be at the river-bank—the
borderland of eternity. So, after a few
moments, he bent over her, whispering:</p>

<p>“Up, beloved—up, and on! We must reach the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
river by dawn. There, my Ahalya, thou mayest sleep—we
may both sleep—long and undisturbed.”</p>

<p>And Ahalya, heeding him in all things, rose and put
her hand in his, and they passed into the night again,
over the plain, toward the distant river.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dawn, white, mistlike, broke slowly upon the world,
over the plains of Dhár, where, to the south of the city,
two armies were encamped: one, that which guarded the
city walls, the joined forces of the Lords of Dhár and of
Mandu; the other, Omar el-Asra, with five thousand
Mohammedan warriors out of Delhi. In the earliest
dim shadow of daylight these two armies stirred, woke,
and swiftly prepared them for the day; till, when the
first shafts of the sun tipped the Indian spear-heads
with red fire, there rose from either line a low, deep
battle-cry,—from the Indian ranks the oath of the
gods: “May the bright bolts of Indra, the discus of
Vishnu, the lingam of Siva protect us to-day!” and from
the other side the cry that was echoing over all the
civilized world, from Granada to Benares, the great
shibboleth of conquest and carnage, before which the
earth bowed: “La-Ilaha-il-lal-laha!” “There is no god
but Allah!” a god of violence and death. And while
these shouts still echoed to the sky, the two lines began
a slow advance, till, ere they met, a great cloud of sun-bright
dust whirled up and around them, and the
haze of impending battle closed them in from mortal
sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Light lifted itself also over the swift-flowing, holy
Narmáda, on the north bank of which stood the man
and the woman, hand in hand, silently watching the
coming of the day. They were exhausted with the
horror and the travail of the long night; but their
minds were now above the physical state. That no
longer mattered. Fidá stood staring at the slowly
lightening waters, his face fixed and very stern.
Ahalya also was still, leaning on the arm of her lover,
her eyes closed. She was not praying, nor did she
even think. Of what was there to think? The past
lay behind them, ended. Of the future there was
none. The present was painless. Like Fidá, she was
tacitly waiting for the first rays of the sun to mark
that spot in the water where It must come.</p>

<p>Just before the first finger of gold was raised over
the Vindhyas, just before the armies in distant Dhár
began their advance, Fidá turned to Ahalya beside
him, and murmured, softly:</p>

<p>“Beloved, it is too terrible for thee. I cannot let
thee die here, thus. See, it is cold, this mountain
water. It comes from far above.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Fidá. We are to go up together. Thou
hast promised it,” she replied quietly, her lips barely
moving.</p>

<p>Fidá uttered a groan. “It is not I—it is not for
myself I falter. But thou—there is no sickness upon
thee—”</p>

<p>“Look! look, beloved, it is the sun! See where it
makes a bed of gold upon the stream! Lift me up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Fidá—carry me out—carry me out and lay me
there—upon our golden bed.”</p>

<p>She turned to him, and he, looking into her upraised
face, could urge no more. Lifting her, with a
last effort, gazing the while deep into her unrepentant
eyes, he sought for the last time her lips, and then—with
a setting of all his muscles—stepped forward
into the stream. The rush of water, even near the
shore, was very swift. It was scarce up to his waist,
no more than covering Ahalya’s ankles, when, suddenly,
he knew that he could not breast the current.
There was a second of agonized realization—a scream
from the woman as she was plunged into the icy flood.
Then came a moment’s struggle with the resistless,
irresistible force, which at one time covered the whirling
bodies and again exposed them to the air. Suddenly
Ahalya was swept into the arms of Fidá. With
the last instinct of life, the hold of each tightened about
the other. Then, in the tumult of the running river,
came a mighty stillness. The current might toss them
as it would. They were alone and one, and there was
for them a moment of indissoluble peace before they
were called up to answer for their deed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, upon the plain of Dhár, the battle-lines
had met, and were mingled in an inextricable mass.
Those watching from on high—Brahma, Vishnu,
Siva, and Allah—might, in the hideous mêlée, have
been able to distinguish one single combat, short, swift,
decisive. There, in the midst of the shouts, shrieks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
and yells, encompassed by flashing weapons and life-streams
running red, two men, Omar el-Asra and Rai-Khizar-Pál
of Mandu, met together, fighting mace and
mace, and, later, sword and sword. One moment, only,
in that chaos of duels, did this endure. Then the
great Rajah, husband of Ahalya the beautiful, conqueror
of an Asra prince, plunged forward from his
saddle, his skull cloven in two by the keen blade of
the Mohammedan warrior.</p>

<p>Thus, in that fair April morning, by devious ways,
four souls that had been closely bound in their earth-life,
went up and met together at the throne of the dread
judge:—Rai-Khizar-Pál, his sceptre laid down forever;
Ragunáth, his faithless minister, passion-spent at last;
and finally, still hand-in-hand, still unrepentant of their
love, Fidá of Yemen and the Ranee Ahalya, not now
flushed with the sweet rose-hue of her Iran.</p>

<small>THE SON OF GOKARNA</small></h3>
</div>


<p>It was July; and in Bul-Ruknu, Vindhya-sheltered,
the rains were over. From now till September one
could but avoid the open sunlight and sleep as much as
the human system would permit. This afternoon the
heat poured blindly over the mud and bamboo village,
and even animals and children had deserted the streets
and sought shelter from the molten sky. One woman,
her head and body wrapped round in bright-colored
cotton, darted out of the close veranda of her own
dwelling and hurried swiftly down the street toward
the spot where, set a little off by itself, stood the
largest and best-built house in the town. Entering
the veranda of this she found seated there, on a pile of
straw cushions, her half-sister, Kota, wife of Gokarna,
the head-man, and at the same time, which was unusual,
chief priest of Siva, the village deity.</p>

<p>Greetings passed between the two; and Kota, causing
her sister to sit beside her, clapped her hands for a
slave who presently appeared in the doorway, a timid,
unkempt girl of fifteen.</p>

<p>“Bring us fruits, Jensa,” commanded her mistress.
Then, as the girl disappeared, she turned to Hilka:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
“’Tis six days since I have seen thee. Are thy gods
propitious?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday, at sacrifice, the omens for the harvest
were bad. But Gokarna has told thee that. How
art thou?”</p>

<p>Kota stirred a little, uncomfortably, and lifted her
languorous eyes to her sister’s face. Just then the
slave came back with custard-apples, early mangoes,
and pomegranates in a basket. Kota took them from
her, proffered the dish to her visitor, who accepted one of
the mangoes, and then, while both began to eat, Kota
said slowly: “I am not happy, my sister. My mind is
troubled. I am filled with melancholy and foreboding
concerning the child. I see many strange visions in
my sleep. The gods refuse me peace.”</p>

<p>“Art thou thus, Kota? That is not right. Yes, I
can see thou art not well. Let Gokarna offer special
sacrifice for thee.”</p>

<p>“He hath done so twice already since the <i>Pumsavana</i>.
But ah, Hilka, I cannot speak my heart to him.
It seems to me as if my thoughts were not my own.
They are put into my mind by evil spirits. I fear
them, and I fear the end. Alas, shall the soul of
this child be evil? I fear it! I fear it!” She spoke
with a nervous intensity that made a strong impression
upon Hilka, who knew well her sister’s lazy, thoughtless
temperament. It was the first time she had ever
perceived any strong feeling in her. Now she said
anxiously: “Go to Naka, at the end of the village, and
get a charm from him to ward off the <i>Devas</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Hush! Gokarna is coming! Do not speak before
him of charms, or he would scold us both.”</p>

<p>Hilka, who had been sitting with her back to the
street, turned hastily, as Kota’s husband appeared in
the veranda entrance:—a tall and austere-looking Brahman,
clad in a long, white garment. He came forward
at once to greet his wife, giving Hilka but a careless
recognition; for, to the head of the village, even his
wife’s relatives were scarcely worthy of attention from
him. And Hilka’s visit was brought to a sudden close;
for no woman of Bul-Ruknu would, from choice, have
stayed long in the proximity of the Priest of Siva.</p>

<p>Kota bade her sister a quiet farewell, not asking her
to come again—rather taking that for granted. And
when the visitor was gone, she turned immediately to
her husband, who touched her on the forehead, answered
briefly her questions concerning the day’s auguries,
and presently left her and went into the house.</p>

<p>Kota, knowing that it would be useless to follow him,
too dreary at heart to care whether or not he talked
with her, returned to her cushions and sat down again
to gaze off into space at the swirling, white heat-waves,
and to dream, vaguely, of days that had never been.</p>

<p>For an Indian, Kota was a pretty woman, her eyes
being very large and soft, and her black hair, just now
woven with yellow champak flowers, thick and long.
She was seventeen years old, and had been married for
three years. Moreover, she had been born a Brahman,
and, in her married life, had been highly honored; for,
though until now she had been childless, her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
had not taken another wife. Above all, Gokarna’s
parents had died in his early youth; so that Kota, at
her marriage made mistress of the finest house in Bul-Ruknu,
had been also spared that terror and curse of
all young Indian women—the mother-in-law, whose
traditional duty it was to make the life of the young
wife one of perpetual misery.</p>

<p>At the time of her marriage, the girl Kota had been
envied by every woman in the village. Later, despite
the unheard-of advantages of her position, she had not
been so much looked up to, for the reason that she was
childless. But, just now, her star was again in the
ascendant, since, in the winter, she was to present
Gokarna’s house with a much-prayed-for heir.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that she was to have what she
herself had most longed for, Kota, as she had just
explained to her sister, was not happy. Her mind was
in an abnormal state; and was seriously affected by the
slightest incident. Highly imaginative, like all her race,
she had always been more or less given to visions and
presentiments; though never so much as now. She would
sit for hours motionless, wrapped in unhappy dreams, or,
as the result of some slight accident, a prey to the keenest
forebodings of evil. These things she did not often
confide to her husband. Nor did she see enough of the
members of her own family to get much comfort from
them. Thus the naturally morbid state of her mind
was fostered and increased by her loneliness and her
secret broodings, till her nights were filled with terror,
and her days were of the length of years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>The hot months passed slowly; and when, after the
early harvest, the fall monsoon came on, Kota grew more
than ever listless and unhappy. Her time was now
much occupied, however, with religious ceremonial;
and, in this respect, probably no woman was ever better
cared for than Kota. The <i>Simontonnayana</i> was made
the occasion of a special festival, which was attended
by the whole village. According to the commands of
the Vedic ritual, the mother was magnificently dressed,
and adorned with gold and jewels. Gokarna sacrificed
a bull to Indra, the flesh of which, after an offering to
the gods, was partaken by everybody. Then the ceremony
of the parting of the hair was performed, and
texts were chanted by all the Brahmans. Only one
event marred the general gayety of the night. At
the end of the prescribed ceremony, and before the
beginning of the feast, Gokarna, following custom, bade
his wife sing the merry festival song: “Taza ba Taza”.
Kota, who had sat silent and solemn through the entire
ceremony, looked up at her husband pleadingly, then
opened her lips, uttered the first words of the song in a
hoarse and trembling tone, and suddenly burst into a
torrent of tears that no entreaty of her friends nor
stern command of her husband could still. This incident
was considered an evil omen; but, in the subsequent
feast and merrymaking, it was quickly forgotten
by all save the poor little mother herself.</p>

<p>After this, Kota did not appear again in public.
Indeed, for the next two moons she spent her time
almost wholly on her bed, attended by Jensa, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
sometimes by Hilka, till, at length, January came. In
the last days, Gokarna suddenly became attentive,
nay, almost tender, to his wife. He was by nature
neither demonstrative nor affectionate. But the matter
of his child touched the dominating note of his nature:—pride.
And he could not but be interested in the
person who had power to present him with sons to whom
he could hand down his state and dignity. Gokarna
was inordinately anxious for a son. Though his dispassionate
nature rebelled bitterly at the thought, he
was determined that, should this child prove to be a
girl, he would take another wife. Meantime, however,
Kota was the object of his highest interest; and not a
little was she astonished when he left the conducting of
the full-moon sacrifices to an under-priest, that he
might stay beside her. He wished to talk with her of
the child. But Kota’s three years of wedded life had
not prepared her to confide her secret thoughts to her
husband, and he got surprisingly little from her on the
subject nearest both of them. His conclusion was that
she was like all women:—too stupid to think. But
had Kota chosen, she could have disclosed to him a
little wonder-world of motherhood that would have
opened his eyes anew to womankind. Melancholy she
had been. Now she was full of dread. Nevertheless,
the sacred love was in her; and, in her brighter hours,
she had given her child all the tenderness of hope, all
the ambitions and desires for its welfare, that her
stunted womanhood could conjure up. For the first
years of its life, at least, the baby would be her own to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
love and to rule. Her heart would have something to
cling to. The dry dust of her existence was about
to put forth flowers and foliage at last. But of such
thoughts, and the joy in them, she could tell Gokarna
nothing, as he sat beside her mat-bed in mid-January
of that year 1207. He could only make ceaseless
inquiries as to her welfare; and, toward nightfall, he was
rewarded by her suddenly sitting up, and crying to him
to send at once for the low-caste nurse who was to
attend her in the coming hours.</p>

<p>These hours were terrible enough, even to the emotionless
Gokarna. Religion forbade his remaining
with his wife, or allowing any but the woman of special
caste to behold her. All he could do was to sit in
the room next to that in which she lay, kindle a sacrificial
fire, repeat over it certain prescribed Vedic texts,
and listen anxiously to the sounds issuing from the
neighboring room. This lasted an unconscionable
time. Then, when the night was at its most solemn
ebb, the moaning and sobbing suddenly ceased,
and silence fell on the priest’s house. This stillness
was far more terrible than the noise had been. Gokarna’s
unemotional nature was stirred to its very
depths. Should he brave the Vedas—and go to her?
While he waited, straining his ears, a new sound came:—a
faint, baby wail that pierced the heart of the man
and caused him to start joyously to his feet. A moment
later the hanging before the doorway was pushed aside,
and the nurse appeared, holding in her arms the child,
wrapped in a piece of cotton cloth. For a second,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Gokarna stood still, choking with hope. Then he ran
forward, and put his hands on the tiny form:</p>

<p>“Is it—is it a boy? Speak!” he said.</p>

<p>The nurse answered not a word, but laid the child
in his arms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not until noon the next day did Gokarna enter the
room where his wife lay. Kota, on the bed, with the
baby beside her, started up as he entered. But the words
on her lips were stopped by his look.</p>

<p>“In the name of the gods, Kota, I give greeting to
thee—and to my son. My son,” he repeated, slowly,
his eyes fixed upon the face of his wife, whose frightened
expression did not diminish. “And thou,” he
continued, turning to the nurse who stood at hand, listening
intently, “see that, on penalty of banishment,
thou prate to none concerning the matters of this
house. I am now come to perform the ceremony of the
breathing and the secret name. Therefore depart,
woman, from the room, nor return until I summon
thee.”</p>

<p>The nurse, alarmed at his tone, made a hasty exit;
and Gokarna turned again to his wife. Nor did he say
another word on the subject nearest both their hearts.
Immediately he took the child from its mother’s arms,
at which it protested, with lusty voice, Kota watching
it the while with tenderest mother-eyes. Gokarna,
holding the child up before him, breathed three times
upon it, and murmured: “Draw in thy breath with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
<i>Rik</i>, breathe within the <i>Yagus</i>, breathe forth with the
<i>Saman</i>.”</p>

<p>Then, handing the babe for a moment back to its
mother, he left the room, shortly returning with the
articles of daily sacrifice:—honey, melted butter, and
barley mixed together in a small earthen dish, in which
stood also a spoon of beaten silver. Placing these on
the floor beside the bed, he seated himself, took the
child again, and looked up to Kota. “The name,” he
said. “Find thou the omen for our name for him.”</p>

<p>Kota stirred uneasily. “Hark!” she said, listening,
“what do they sing there without:—what song?”</p>

<p>Somewhere in the village a chant was sounding, the
words as yet indistinct, but becoming gradually louder,
till a little procession passed Gokarna’s house, uttering
these words, over their heavy and sorrowful burden:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Call on Rama! Call to Rama!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, my Brothers, call on Rama!</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">For this dead</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Whom we bring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call aloud to mighty Rama!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Rama!” echoed Kota, tremulously. “God of
death!—Alas! Alas! That is the omen.”</p>

<p>“It is surely an evil omen that a funeral should pass
the house of the new-born. Yet Rama is a god. He
must be honored. Let the secret name of the child be
‘Ramasarman.’ There are the four, holy Brahmanic
syllables. ‘Ramasarman.’ Say it with me, Kota.”</p>

<p>And the mother, with tears in her eyes and in her
voice, repeated with her husband the words that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
gave her first-born a secret name of death. And
when this ceremony was over, receiving the baby
once more into her arms, she wept over it, quietly and
persistently, throughout the afternoon.</p>

<small>OMAN THE CHILD</small></h3>
</div>


<p>It was thus that the child of the head-man and high
priest of Bul-Ruknu entered the world and found his
place there. But his subsequent baby days did not
bear out the dreary omens of the first. The whole
town, and a throng of farmers from the rice-fields to
the north, were present at the ceremony of the public
christening of the child, who was named Oman, and was
thenceforward regarded by the village as their prospective
head and ruler. As such he became at once an
important little person, both in the community and in
his father’s house.</p>

<p>Having been born a Brahman, Oman’s first year
was punctuated with ceremonies prescribed for every
minutest change in his little existence. In his sixth
month, at the first feeding with solid food, upon which
the character of his future career was supposed to
depend, he was given, not rice, to bring him splendor;
nor beef, to bring him power; nor fish, to bring him
swiftness; nor goat’s flesh, for a fine physique; but
a bit of white partridge breast, which is said to confer
upon a child the gift of mental purity. And from this
time on, every step in his education was for the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
of making him a worthy successor to his ascetic father.
From his earliest babyhood he was trained in rigorous
ways of propriety and grave conduct. Much
speech, inarticulate or otherwise, was not sanctioned in
Gokarna’s presence; nor did the father sympathetically
regard the manufacture of mud-pies, or even the
jingling of Kota’s ankle-bells and bracelets. The
delights of babyhood were indulged in secret, at times
when Kota’s warm-hearted motherhood overcame the
unceasing dread of her husband; and she and the baby
found amusements that delighted them equally.</p>

<p>During the first three years of his life, Oman certainly
gave no evidence of unusual characteristics. When he
was two, and his mother nineteen, a girl was born into
the family of the high priest, which fact, however, in
no way diminished Oman’s importance. He was now
at a delightful age; and even Gokarna sometimes fell
from dignity and allowed his son to drag himself to
his feet by aid of the paternal leg, and then, by means
of the same member, permitted himself to be urged
out to witness the antics of some badgered kitten, or
peep into the first home of half a dozen tumbling
puppies; which creatures the child never molested, but
would watch by the hour with solemn delight.</p>

<p>In his third year, little Oman underwent the ceremony
of the <i>Kudakarman</i>, or tonsure, by which his rough and
tumbly black hair was clipped close to his head, and
thenceforth kept so:—a very comfortable bit of religion,
considering the climate of Bul-Ruknu. This concluded
the ceremonies of babyhood, and was the last he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
should have to undergo till the day of the great initiation,
or second birth, when he would become a true
Brahman, a student of the Vedas.</p>

<p>This period, from his third to his eighth year, was
the happiest and freest of his life. He was now emancipated
from the close supervision of his mother, and
allowed to go forth alone to explore the wonders and
the glories of the town. All the simple and unfathomable
joys of childhood were there, awaiting his pleasure.
First of all were the children; for Bul-Ruknu
swarmed with them; and, boy and girl, Brahman or
Sudra, they were turned out to live in the streets till it
came time for them to take up the duties of life:—the
boys, from seven to twelve, to begin their Vedic studies
or their slavery; the girls, from ten to fourteen, to
marry. Little Oman, so far brought up to the most rigid
solitude, now entered the world, and found hordes of his
own kind awaiting him. Forthwith he offered himself
to them. They accepted him readily into their
numbers, and let him find his own place there. They
ranked him nowhere, for their spirit was entirely democratic.
They were the only species of Indian humanity
that did not, openly or secretly, recognize caste. With
them, it was not a Brahman who must lead, but the boy
who could fight best; it was not the girl of wealthiest
parents that was most popular, but she that had greatest
talent for making dolls out of straw and rags.</p>

<p>Among his kind Oman did not make astonishing progress.
He proved gentle and quiet, and made friends,
in a mute sort of way, with those of his own age or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
little younger. He never attempted leadership. As
a matter of fact, such an idea did not occur to
him. But he was thoroughly intolerant of any sort
of ruling. The boy that tried to command his occupations,
he regarded with astonished disapproval, immediately
renouncing the acquaintance of the would-be
general. He never fought,—had, indeed, been known
to run away from the scene of a struggle, and hide himself
till it was over. Yet his spirit was not generally
considered cowardly. The result of this course was that,
gradually, Oman gathered around him a handful of little
folk like himself, among whom he always felt at liberty
to do what he liked. They were an odd little band.
Among them were no concerted plans of action, no organized
raids, hardly even general games. Each child,
occupied with some pursuit of his or her own, would
simply carry it on in the proximity of others, because
the feeling of companionship was pleasant. Oman,
indeed, after the first novelty of it had worn off, did
not always remain with his fellows. There were
many things that he found it eminently pleasant to
do alone. For him the town held ever fresh delights.
He knew every donkey that came to the weekly bazaar.
He was also on friendly terms with the troops of dogs,
the cats, and the chickens of his immediate neighborhood.
Animals liked him, and he returned their affection
with warm appreciation. Nor was he ever known
to harm, or even so much as startle, any living thing.
And this extreme gentleness was perhaps his most distinguishing
characteristic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>In due time this child of high future approached his
eighth birthday, and, at that early age, entered upon the
rigorous life of the Snataka, or student of the Vedas.
The ceremony of second birth, investiture with the
sacred cord of the Brahman, was the most important
event of his life, since he was universally looked upon
as the successor of his father, the future high priest of
the village. The girdle of Menga grass was fastened
round his waist and the cord knotted over his left
shoulder. Into his hand they put a staff made of the
polished bilva wood prescribed for the Brahman student.
Aside from these things, and the single cotton
garment that he wore, all the possessions that had been
his in the world were supposed to belong to his teacher,
who was a priest under Gokarna, a man named Asvarman,
who had taken four pupils, of whom Oman was
the youngest.</p>

<p>It was at this time of the first separation from her
oldest child that Kota brought into the world a new
son, who, for the time being, took up all her thoughts.
And from the hour of this boy’s birth, Oman’s prospects,
though he was unaware of the fact, assumed a
different aspect. His career depended now upon his
own abilities; for he was no longer indispensable to the
ambitions of his father.</p>

<p>When a Hindoo boy begins his studentship, which
lasts for an indeterminate number of years, he is no
longer regarded as an inmate of his father’s house, but
is wholly under the supervision of his instructor, and
is supposed to beg his food and lodging from persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
charitably inclined. As a general rule, the boy still
eats at home; but his meals are given him not in the
name of relationship, but as a charity asked for the
sake of the gods. Beside this quasi-exile, Oman found
his life a very different matter from the former free
and comfortable existence. No longer could he call
a single hour of the day his own. His initiation as a
student had taken place in the early spring of the
year 1215, and was immediately followed by the great
<i>Sravana</i> festival for the planting of crops and the
<i>Adhya-Yopa-Karman</i>, or opening of the course of
study. His part in the religious ceremonies lasted for
a week, during which time there was much fasting and
little sleep. Then, on the new-moon day of the month
of March, began the routine that was to last, almost
unbroken, for five years.</p>

<p>Every morning, between dawn and sunrise, Oman
and his three fellow-students assembled in the broad,
sandy square near the apology of a temple to Siva, and
there replenished the sacrificial fires, which were never
extinguished. When the blaze was high and the sun
had reached the horizon, Asvarman would make his
appearance, and, seating himself before a fire with his
face to the east, his pupils opposite him on the other
side of the blaze, would begin the morning recitation
of prayers—a dozen verses of the Rig-Veda, already
familiar to the boys. After this, the students were
instructed in Pâli texts, generally committing to heart
each sentence as it was read. At noon they were dismissed
to beg a meal in the village; and, early in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
afternoon, they returned to continue their study, which
lasted till sunset, when the evening Agnihotra was performed
and they were dismissed for the night, burdened
with an endless list of rules which they must not
break on pain of penance. The only relief from this
monotonous existence came on Uposatha days:—days
of sacrifice to the new or the full moon; and certain
sacred festival days, when ceremonial took the place of
the usual study.</p>

<p>In a year, by means of this persistent application,
the boys were able to read with tolerable fluency,
both in Pâli and in Sanscrit. But the rigor of their
labors was not lessened thereby. Rather, instruction
now took a severer turn; for, young as they were, the
little students were of Brahman birth, and, therefore,
entitled to the highest education. According to
the law, Asvarman now began to expound to these
pathetic children the doctrines of the three mystic philosophies:—the
Sankhya, the Vedanta, and the Yoga—speculations
of such profound abstraction and such absolute
intellectuality, that their effect on these childish
minds would have been amusing had it not been pitiable.
Solemnly, with his wide, unfathomable eyes fixed
on the dull orbs of the priest, Oman, now at the age of
nine, informed his master that Nature was created in
order that the world-soul might become united with
itself; that contemplation is the soul’s highest duty till
its time of liberation from material fetters; and that
only essence is infinite.</p>

<p>Just how much of this found some sort of home in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
the boy’s young mind, to reappear long years afterward
with new meaning attached to it, it were difficult to
say. Probably it was at this time, and through the
agency of those vast philosophisms, that Oman’s double
self began dimly to be shadowed forth. By the time
he was eleven, and had been for three years a Snataka,
he commenced in his own fashion to meditate, and, also
in his own fashion, to suffer. Much that had hitherto
lain dormant within him began to stir. He realized
that he could scarcely fathom his own state. There
seemed to lie within him two distinct natures: the one
strong, non-combative, but self-rebellious; the other
gentle, and weak, and shrinking. Until now he had
had no clear idea of this. He had been all things at
once. But the elements were beginning to resolve themselves.
He had moods, of longer or shorter duration,
during which one set of characteristics or the other
seemed to dominate him. Half the time he wondered
at himself angrily for his indecisiveness. The other
half he shrank from self-analysis, and from any effort
at study as well.</p>

<p>Immersed as he was in a self-conflict which he believed
to be part of everybody’s ordinary life, his
attempts at understanding himself tinctured all his
thoughts, and his questions as to the philosophies and
their significance always bore a personal relation to
himself and his needs. Here he found not a little
assistance. But with the Vedas it was different.
There was nothing there to apply in any way to the
inner life. The formal ritual, the Sutras, the Mantras,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
were all mere objective texts. And, gradually, as he
strove in vain to find in them something personal, their
meaningless intricacy impressed itself more and more
upon him.</p>

<p>His life, at this time, was far from happy. He was
closely bound, even as to his thoughts; and he had
really no freedom. His state was almost constantly
one of melancholy; but he was subject to violently
changeable points of view; and, in his continual secret
analysis and meditation, he endured the first pangs of
loneliness. How strongly he felt all this, it would be
difficult to say. At the time, his existence seemed to
him overwhelming. Later on, he could remember it
with yearning, as holding a peace and a contentment
that would never come for him again.</p>

<p>The years passed over the head of the boy, slowly
for him, swiftly for many around him; and when he
was thirteen years old, and had been for five years a
Snataka, a heavy sickness came, and he was taken
to the home of his father, to be cared for there. He
alone knew how, for many days, his body and his
mind were torn with strangest anguish. Dimly he
understood that the souls imprisoned in him were
struggling mightily to burst the bonds of flesh, and
free themselves. Finally came the evening that was
always most vivid in his memory.</p>

<p>Toward sunset he was carried out into the vine-walled
veranda of the house; and he felt that people—two,
three, four—stood around him, looking upon him.
He heard murmurings and exclamations, which gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
melted away; and then only his father and mother
were there, standing on either side of him; and he felt
afraid, and wept, in misery.</p>

<p>There, indeed, through the whole night, the man
and the woman who had brought him into the world
stood over him in the agony of the crisis, Kota shaken
with sobs of affliction, Gokarna stiff and straight,
hands clenched, skin damp with sweat. There the
father gave up his son, the priest renounced his hope
and his ambition. Lifting up his voice he prayed
Siva to take the life of Ramasarman; and this prayer
the child, and the mother of the child, dumbly echoed
in their hearts. Yet, in the clear, red light of dawn,
the agony left Oman’s body, and his mind, exhausted
with a weight too terrible to bear, grew gradually
quieter. Kota and Gokarna, knowing nothing more to
do, spent with weariness and emotion, returned together
in silence into the house, leaving Oman alone in the
half-light of early day.</p>

<p>The child’s first sensation was one of extreme
peace. Pain had left him; and the eyes, half curious,
half horrified, that had watched him through the night,
were gone. The early air came fresh and sweet to
his dry lips; and it seemed to act on him as a powerful
narcotic. He grew languorous and drowsy. The
spirit within him was still; yet, somewhere, there was a
tension. He could not quite give himself up to insensibility.
Was it habit:—the old sense of rising at this
hour to prepare the sacrifice? Not that. The Vedic
ritual, and all its infinite detail, lay quite outside his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
path just now. No; it was rather a curious sense of
expectation, of waiting for something to come—what,
he neither knew nor asked. But the waiting was not
long. From out of that clear, vermilion dawn-light,
came flying a tiny, gray bird,—Spirit-bird, Hindoos
call it,—slender-necked, clean-winged. This, hovering
for an instant about the entrance to the veranda, darted
suddenly in and plunged, quivering, into Oman’s
breast.</p>

<p>The boy gave a faint cry—expressive of unutterable
things—and laid his two hands with greatest gentleness
upon the soft feathers, caressing the creature,
and uttering to it little, inarticulate sounds. With
the coming of this bird it was as if his being was
suddenly complete. Now, for the moment, happy with
a happiness that is beyond mortals, still clasping to his
breast the feathered thing, which, under his touch, lay
perfectly still, he closed his hot and aching eyes and
slept.</p>

<small>HIS SOLITUDE</small></h3>
</div>


<p>When Oman woke, the sun was high in the heavens,
and the bird had gone. During his sleep some one—his
mother, doubtless—had covered him with a pliable
mat, and had placed something soft under his head.
Full consciousness returned by degrees. A sense of
physical discomfort was the first thing he knew. Then
came a faint memory of what had happened before the
dawn. Sunrise and the bird were inextricably mingled
in his mind. In his heart he believed that the bird and
the peace it brought had been a dream. Now that he
was fully awake, there was no peace. He was hot with
fever; and soon his body began to ache again, with a
dull, numb pain that was hard to bear in silence.
Moreover, he panted for water. It was not long, however,
before Kota came out into the veranda, her little
boy clinging to her skirts and retarding her progress.
Disengaging the child, who fell backward disconsolately,
she bent over the sick one, felt the burning of
his hands and head, drew from him confession of his
pain and also of his hunger and thirst, and at once
retired into the house, to return in a few moments
with a bowl of millet and milk. She found the baby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
sitting beside Oman, who was talking to it in his
mellow, gentle voice. Kota hastily set the bowl upon
the ground, picked up the baby, carried him inside,
and, on coming back once more, found Oman lying on
his face, shaken with sobs; nor could she, for a long
time, persuade him to turn his face to the light and
take the nourishment he needed.</p>

<p>Despite his mother’s furtively loving care, and the
cessation of his exacting duties, Oman did not grow
better of his sickness. Instead, his fever increased
till delirium came, and for days he was out of his
mind. In his times of pain he would become violent,
screaming and struggling when any one approached
him. He talked much. Snatches of Vedic text, old
Sutras and Mantras, philosophical premises, and suggestions
of his own self-struggle were jumbled together
in wildest chaos. Gokarna, dreading to have a woman’s
ears hear the holy words that are forbidden to women,
dreading still more the alternative of a masculine Sudra
nurse, sure to carry gossip, had Oman carefully guarded
and tended within the house. In his heart, the father,
bitter with grief and worse than grief at the outcome
of Oman’s student-life, repeated many times his prayer
for the child’s death; and had he been in a state to
realize anything, Oman would have echoed that prayer
with all his heart.</p>

<p>Desire, however, was vain. For four weeks Oman
lay fever-stricken, and then, suddenly, began to convalesce,
and in a fortnight more was about as usual.
Spring was now nearly gone, and summer, with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
murderous heat, upon the town again. The crops
were up, and the business of irrigation begun in the
fields; for all the luxuriant foliage of the wild was
withered and dry, parched for the rains that were not
yet to come for a month or more. Among the townsfolk,
in the evening, the great subject of gossip was
always: “The Child of Gokarna—called Oman.” “He
has given up the life of the Snataka.” “No more does
he study the sacred books.” “Yet the ceremony of
the cessation of study has not taken place.” “Ah, yes,
something is wrong. It is very strange.”</p>

<p>Oman still wore the sacred cord of the Brahman.
How should he, knowing so much of the holy Vedas,
remove it? But he moved through his native town a
wanderer, an outcast, addressing none of the townspeople,
who would scarcely have answered him for fear
of defiling their caste. How this situation had come
about, Oman could not have told. It had been a
gradual and natural growth. During his convalescence
it had occurred to him that his father and
mother were ashamed of him. This idea he tested in
various ways, and found it to be true. Up to that
time he had been ashamed of himself: furiously, bitterly
rebellious concerning his weakness. But now, at
once, the spirit of self-protection rose hot within him.
Others, his own parents, were ashamed of him. Should
he turn against himself? Never. The masculine instinct
of self-defence turned inward toward that other
timid, shrinking nature that he longed so to conceal.
And when, at length, he was about again, his parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
found him wrapped in an impenetrable mantle of—was
it pride?—was it stupidity?—was it temper?—arrogance?
He was unapproachable and unsociable.
He took not the slightest notice of those around him,
never speaking of his own accord, and doing his best to
prevent the address of others.</p>

<p>Gokarna held many periods of self-communion with
himself as to his duty toward this child, and especially
about the matter of the sacred cord. But time passed,
and no special action was taken. Oman seemed to
have marked out his life for himself; and the father,
bewildered, let him pursue the course he would, and
finally ceased to torment himself with questions.</p>

<p>Through the rainy season, Oman spent most of his
time close to his father’s house. There was a place
for him there, such as it was, where he was never molested.
In the first weeks of his recovery, his over-worked
mind found some delight in simple freedom
from burdensome tasks. Idleness, silence, absence of
rules and binding regulations, were sweet to him. He
had the true Hindoo faculty for dreams, and would sit
for hours lost in contemplation of unknowable and
unfathomable things. Little objects—the bluish curl
of smoke over a house-roof, the distant, flickering flame
of sacrificial fires at dusk, a flight of heron toward the
southern hills, the notes of the bulbul or the koïl—such
things brought him infinite pleasure, and formed subjects
for long contemplation. These were the periods
when his mind was freest from its burden. But there
were hours—days—weeks, when the world gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
nothing to him; when melancholy held him for her
own. At these times life seemed a burden too terrible
for any mortal, and the continuance of such suffering
as his, a thing beyond the endurance of spirits of the
blessed.</p>

<p>When the rains were over, and August came in,
Oman began to spend much time wandering through
the countryside, returning to the village only to eat
and sleep:—sometimes not that. The country around
Bul-Ruknu was broken, fertile, and unusually picturesque
for India. To the east and southeast, at a
distance of three or four miles, rose the northernmost
hills of the Vindhya range, which extended thence,
southward, to the Narmáda plain, fifty miles away.
To the north and west were stretches of fertile fields,
fringed with woods, and watered by a little stream fed
by mountain brooks and springs, that went meandering
through bottom-lands, and was used by farmers for
purposes of irrigation. Very early in the course of his
wanderings, Oman came upon this little river. During
his childhood he had exhibited the curious trait of
marked aversion to running water; but he found now
that the old dread of it lingered only in a half-fascinating
fear lest some day, out of very wantonness, he
should plunge into the little stream and resistlessly let
himself be overwhelmed in its lucent depths. This
fascination did not diminish with time. He loved to
explore its windings through the countryside, and
follow it up a little way into its mountain fastnesses.
In the hills, one day, he came upon a shadowy glade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
turfed with kusa-grass and canopied with a giant banyan
grove, a tree of a hundred trunks, that overspread
two acres of ground. Here, in the green twilight, in a
spot to which human beings never penetrated, Oman
found his haven:—a haven of solitude where, for three
or four years, he spent the greater part of his time.</p>

<p>Of the struggles, the wretched inward conflicts of
this isolated mortal developing alone, unaided, avoided
by humankind, it were terrible to speak. Physical
maturity had come before the mental; and it was here,
in this scene of lonely beauty, that he passed through
the first, fierce stages of the new awakening. He was
most miserably human; and all the faults of humanity
raged within him, unrestrained and uncomprehended.
He yearned constantly for that of which he could know
nothing; and, helpless and half-mad, he was tossed
upon a sea of morbid and lonely imaginings. At such
times, the fact that he was an outcast seemed to him
hideous and impossible. Rebelling, he would rise up
and curse himself and the God of his creation. Then,
when he had spent himself in tragical invective, the
other side of him would take possession of his mind,
and he would melt into tremulous weeping: weeping
so piteous, so forlorn, that it would have melted
the heart of any woman hearing it. Again, Oman was
filled with a gentle and eager desire for something on
which to expend affection:—a dog, a kitten, a bird,—any
living thing that would accept his love. But
nothing came to him. It seemed as if the very beasts
avoided his haunts. A few apes were occasionally seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
within the banyan grove; but no other living thing
passed through there, nor even a snake slept in the
shadow of its stones. Yet the hills beyond were alive
with wild creatures. By night lions cried through the
great darkness. Immense troops of monkeys chattered
in the trees. Both the tiger and the bear dwelt in the
ravines; and the buffalo and antelope found pasturage
on sunny hillsides. The steepest crags were the resort
of myriad wild goats, and birds of all kinds winged
their way over the heights and found their nests by
hundreds in the jungle trees. But in the midst of all
this wild, free life, Oman dwelt alone, unsought, lost in
the wilderness of his solitude.</p>

<p>How, through three long years, he managed so to
occupy his mind as to keep at bay the madness that
besets the absolutely solitary, he himself knew best.
Probably the first months seemed longest. The hours
were dismissed, one by one, while he busied himself
over little things; for, at his age, he was not able
to create a systematic pursuit. His mind worked
in unaccustomed spheres, conning, vaguely and indefinitely,
problems that put him at a more or less
safe distance from himself. In time, the atmosphere
of the deep banyan shade, with the near tinkling
and flashing of the brook, and the dim, greenish sunlight
that slipped through the interwoven foliage,
became so beautifully familiar that it was home to
him. He bathed and floated in the chilly water, and
afterwards kindled a sacrificial fire and sat before
it on his knees, delighting in the high-leaping flames,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
feeling that the play of the two elements satisfied his
bent of mind. And during this time, by unconscious
cerebration, what Oman had learned in his five years
of studentship, all that mass of inert, half-decayed
knowledge, concentrated into living truths that fixed
themselves firmly in his brain and lay waiting to be
used. Something further still came out of the solitude:—a
self-dependence, a strength, and a fortitude
without which, at a later period, he could not have
lived.</p>

<p>Thus, until his sixteenth year, Oman spent his days.
Then a change came upon him, and he felt this life
unendurable. Insensibly, a scene from one of the old,
heroic epics that he had read in his student days, came
to him, fastened itself in his mind, and would not
be dislodged. It was the picture of the “Sinner’s
Road”, described with ghastly vividness by a long-dead
writer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A burning forest shut the roadside in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On either hand; and mid its crackling boughs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perched ghastly birds—or flapped among the flames—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vultures and kites and crows, with brazen plumes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And beaks of iron; and these grisly fowl</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Screamed to the shrieks of Prets, lean, famished ghosts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Featureless, eyeless, having pin-point mouths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That hungered, but were never full.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here, in the land where these dim spirits dwelt,
Oman, in perilous despair, beheld himself. He must
die as he had lived, and live in death as he had lived
in life—miserable, desolate, desperate, without hope of
betterment. And then, as the days scourged him, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
was finally driven to take a stand, for sanity’s sake.
Thus, one noontide, he girded himself up and returned
to Bul-Ruknu, and there, within his father’s house,
sought an interview with Gokarna.</p>

<p>It was a long and solemn talk. Since the days of his
sickness, three years before, Oman and his father had
spoken scarcely a dozen words together. True, he
usually slept at home, and his mother always left him
food for the day in a corner of the veranda. But he
was not of his family. In the village he had come to
be looked on as a recluse, almost a hermit; and as such
was in some measure respected. Now, however, Oman
had come to demand one of two things: speedy death,
or a place in the world. Gokarna was taken aback,
demurred, finally offered his son a menial position
among the priests, which Oman straightway refused.</p>

<p>“My brain is sick of religion and the gods. My
power of worship is spent. Let me work.”</p>

<p>“Work! You are a Brahman.”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest I am not—cannot be.”</p>

<p>Gokarna glared at him, and muttered some sort of
insult; whereupon Oman rose and left his father, and
within twelve hours apprenticed himself to a weaver in
the town, thereby renouncing caste and becoming one
of the Vaisyas, the lowest order to whom was granted
the right of re-birth and investiture with the sacred
cord. Yet, in the village, Oman was now regarded as a
privileged being; and, after a week of banishment from
his home, during which time he worked steadily and
well, Kota went to him, and begged him to return to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
his father’s house, to sleep and eat as he had been wont
to do; and when Gokarna sent a message to the same
effect, Oman, for his mother’s sake, consented, and
resumed the old relations with his people. He could
not, of course, eat in their presence, nor sleep in the
same room with one of them, nor take part in the Agnihotra.
But at night he was there, in the veranda, as
of old; and the heart of his mother was at peace.</p>

<p>Now, in the endless sunshine, Oman Ramasarman
worked at his trade: first combing and carding the
wool, later dyeing it, then learning how to mix the different
threads for warp and woof, and finally sitting
down to the loom, where, under his skilful manipulation,
the cloth was turned off, smooth and strong and
useful. And now, at last, Oman’s thoughts were taken
from himself, and he was like a busy child, playing at
work, working at play, till two swift years had rolled
round again, and it was the spring of the year 1224,
with Oman in his eighteenth year of expiative life.</p>

<small>HUSHKA IN THE MARKET-PLACE</small></h3>
</div>


<p>It was spring. The Sravana sacrifices were over.
Farmers had finished their planting, and the world ran
with life. As yet, there was no presage of summer
heat. The nights were cool, and the mornings soft as
in winter. But the new foliage was delicately bright,
and more tender flowers had come to join the perpetual
blossoms. Almond and apricot trees were in bloom;
and the breeze was perfumed with orchard breaths.
The mongoose and the turtle began their rovings.
There was an air of love and liberty in all things; and
the heart of Oman was filled with suppressed yearning.
He worked as steadily as usual; but his thoughts went
wandering. For the first time since the day he had
left the banyan grove, he desired solitude. But it was
solitude in a new form. He felt in him the longing to
wander, to roam the land, to penetrate distant places
that he had heard of:—great cities and fair plains,
where historic men had dwelt.</p>

<p>Gradually he fell into the habit of dreaming over
this new ambition; and by degrees strange pictures
rose up before him:—pictures of places that he had
seen and known, somewhere, somehow, perhaps only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
as myths in an epic, perhaps actually, in an old life.
And with these pictures was always the unattainable—a
golden thread, running in and out of all his dreams:
the thought of that which he already had perceived to
soften the whole world,—love—the love of man for
woman, the love of woman for man. And dangerous
as this brooding was, it grew so dear to him that he
could not relinquish it, but cherished it, secretly, as a
gift from the high gods.</p>

<p>There came an evening when he betrayed his
thoughts, involuntarily, resistlessly, to the one being
in the world who would try to understand them. And
forever after he rejoiced that he had done so. He
was sitting alone in the veranda of Gokarna’s house,
waiting for his meal of millet-cakes and milk, which
Kota presently brought. Then, when she had laid it
before him, she walked slowly over to the veranda
entrance and seated herself there, and looked off upon
the swift-falling dusk. In the misty radiance of the
sunset, still more under the spell of the rising night,
spangled with white stars, the little village of mud
and straw lost its marks of poverty and squalor, and
was softened into a dream-city, of ineffable delicacy.
As they sat looking out upon it now, the
thoughts of mother and son were alike, except that
Oman was regretting what he could never have, and
Kota that which had not been given her, for Gokarna
was not such a man as the springtime loves. But
mother and son felt a sympathy with each other, and,
under this sense, the nature of each expanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, it is one of Krishna’s nights,” murmured Kota,
dreamily.</p>

<p>For answer, Oman sighed; and the sigh came from
his soul.</p>

<p>Kota turned and looked at the young man.
Hitherto, Oman’s heart had been strange to her; she
had never thought of questioning the workings of his
brain. Now, suddenly, his humanity was apparent;
and her heart went out to his human sorrow as she
asked, gently: “Dost thou mourn, Oman?”</p>

<p>Oman, for whom no human voice had ever taken
on this tone, felt a throb of gratitude. But he answered:
“I do not mourn, mother. I do not mourn.
And yet it is the time of love; and for me there is no
love.”</p>

<p>Though caste forbade it, she went over and sat down
at his side, and took his two hands in hers. “Thinkest
thou there is none to love thee?” she asked, tenderly.</p>

<p>Oman’s head drooped to his knees; and, resting it
there, he let some part of his sorrow find expression for
the woman, and her tears rained down with his, while,
forgetting all but her motherhood, she clasped him to
her heart.</p>

<p>After Oman’s emotion had spent itself, and he had
become quiet, Kota remained at his side, and together
they looked off upon the village, over which the half-grown
moon was now shedding a bluish silver light.
The two sat silent, watching, till the moon was past
mid-heaven, and halfway down the sky. Gokarna
had not returned. He would evidently sleep that night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
with the snatakas and priests in the square of sacrifice.
But at last Kota, rising reluctantly, left the night
behind, and sought her rest in the house, while Oman
lay down in his accustomed corner of the veranda, and,
after a little, slept.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again, the sun was nearly
in mid-sky. He would unquestionably get a beating
from the master weaver, when he reached his loom.
However, it must be faced; and, without pausing for
food, he rose, thinking to make his ablutions at a fountain
on the way. Reaching the veranda step, however,
he paused. A man was standing there, silently: a
man clad in mud-stained yellow robes, holding in his
hand a wooden bowl. Oman looked at him with some
curiosity. A century or two before, such men had
overrun all India. Now, so rarely was one seen that
he was an object of interest to every beholder. In the
days when the wild Brahmanic leader, Kumarila Bhatta,
had raised his brethren against the Buddhists, it had
been death to this man to stand thus at a Brahman’s
door; for, unquestionably, he was a Bhikkhu, a Buddhist
mendicant monk, come out of Bágh, the one
remaining stronghold of Buddhism in Malwa, one of
the few left in all India. And the man stood here,
quite still, silently asking alms. Pity and curiosity
were nowadays the only sentiments with which even
Brahmans regarded these harmless men. And Oman,
after a moment’s halt, would have hurried on, but that
he caught the expression in the wanderer’s eyes, and
paused to look again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>Certainly it was a remarkable face. The eyes were
very large, and dark, and long-lashed; and the look
in them was such as one finds in oxen. The man’s
body was lean to emaciation; but his face, owing to the
round-cut hair, had more or less of a full appearance.
His robes—which he wore in the regular Buddhist
manner, over the left shoulder, under the right, and
reaching to the heels,—were well worn, as were his
sandals, and the knotty, wooden staff in his hand. On
his back was a small bundle, fastened with a rope; and
this, with an alms-bowl, completed his equipment for
the eight months’ yearly pilgrimage prescribed for
every Bhikkhu.</p>

<p>When his swift scrutiny was ended, Oman, following
a sudden impulse, went a little closer to the man, and
said, gently: “Peace to your heart, reverend sir. Let
me fill your bowl with food.”</p>

<p>The Bhikkhu bowed, and silently handed his dish to
the young man, regarding him the while with grave
scrutiny. Oman carried the bowl inside, and requested
his mother to fill it with whatever was at hand. Kota,
decidedly taken aback, complied with the request,
albeit it was the first Buddhist bowl ever filled in that
Brahman household. Kota prepared a dish for her son
at the same time; and Oman carried them both outside.
The monk received his with humble thanks; and,
squatting on the ground where he was, without prayer
or ceremony began his meal. Oman watched him for
a moment, and concluded that, since he was already
half a day late, another hour would make little difference.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
So he sat down at some distance from the
stranger, and himself began to eat. They finished at
the same time, and, rising, faced each other inquiringly.
This time it was the monk who spoke.</p>

<p>“For thine alms, I give thee thanks. One favor more
I will ask of thee. Tell me in what direction lies the
bazaar; for thither I must go to preach Dharma<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to
the people.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Dharma: Truth, the Word, the Law.</p>

</div>

<p>“O Bhikkhu, on my way to work I shall pass through
the bazaar. If you will walk with me, I will lead you
thither.”</p>

<p>The monk looked astonished at this civility, but
agreed at once to the proposal; and, Oman having left
his dish on the veranda, they started down the winding
street in the direction of the market-place. As they
went, they talked, scatteringly, and Oman found himself
listening with delight to the low, mellow tones of
his companion’s voice. The Bhikkhu’s name, he found,
was Hushka. He was now returning from his pilgrimage
and on his way to Bágh, where he was to
spend the summer months, the Yassa season, in one of
the Viharas there.</p>

<p>When they reached the bazaar, they found in it a busy
throng of men and women, buying, selling, shouting,
laughing, wrangling, gossiping together, each contributing
in some way to the general tumult. Oman wondered
not a little how his companion was going to obtain hearing
here. Hushka, however, appeared as untroubled
as if he had mounted a platform before a respectfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
attentive multitude; and Oman, interested in the prospect,
still lingered, watching his chance acquaintance.</p>

<p>First, the Bhikkhu reminded Oman of his own personal
neglect, by going to the fountain in the middle
of the square, and carefully washing out his alms-bowl.
When it was cleaned and dried, he still stood, resting
one hand upon the stone, looking thoughtfully around
him. One or two people, passing, caught his eye, and
halted, uncertainly. Then three or four middle-aged
and old men drew out of the throng and stood still,
close at hand. They were those that had a curiosity
concerning the dying faith: perhaps even, in their
secret hearts, leaned a little toward it; and usually
availed themselves of each rare opportunity of listening
to the Dharma.</p>

<p>Having now before him the nucleus of an audience,
Hushka faced them, his back to the fountain. Absently
he stuck his flat bowl into the pouch depending from
his leathern girdle, fixing his eyes, the while, upon
Oman, who, fascinated by the man’s simplicity, still
stood, apart from the others, watching and waiting.
And now the Buddhist lifted both hands, clasped them
high before him, and repeated, in tones of greatest
reverence, the Buddhist profession of faith, with which
all mendicant preachers were accustomed to begin
their discourse:</p>

<p>“‘Of all things proceeding from cause, their causes
hath the Tathagata (Buddha) explained. The great
Sramana (Buddha) hath likewise explained the causes
of the cessation of existence.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>At these words, spoken in a low, melodious, monotonous
voice, addressed, not to the people, but, apparently,
to Heaven, Oman, unconscious of himself, took
a step nearer to the speaker. After a slight pause,
Hushka, now removing his eyes from Oman’s face and
using them at discretion, began his sermon, choosing language
that was clear and simple, using figures calculated
to appeal to the people, carrying his hearers with him by
means of his own personal magnetism, which was never
at so high a pitch as when he was engaged in this kind
of speaking. Gradually, his audience increased in
numbers. The little group of half a dozen became
twelve, and then twenty, and then forty, till the clamor
in the market-place was strangely diminished, and
buyers and sellers alike stood still before the power of
this wanderer of alien and dying faith, surnamed, by
his brethren of the Vihara, “honey-throated”, and
“golden-tongued”.</p>

<p>And this was the nature of his address; these the
words that he spoke:</p>

<p>“Have you considered, O people, how all that we are
is the result of what we have thought? Our life is
founded on our thoughts, made up of our thoughts.
If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain
follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox
that draws the vehicle.</p>

<p>“‘I am abused, miserable, receive not my due in
the world.’ For him who constantly harbors such
thoughts, there is unending discontent. But for him
who reflects: ‘I am happy in living, for the world is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
spot of joy and beauty,’ discontent will cease forever.
And so, also, hatred will never cease by hatred. Hatred
ceases through love. This is an old rule. Again, he
who lives seeking pleasures only, his senses unbridled,
his nature through indulgence growing idle and weak,
him will Mara (the tempter) overthrow, as the wind
blows down a rotten tree. But for him who lives to
labor and to love his fellows, his senses controlled, his
appetites moderate, faithful and strong in his work,
him Mara can no more overthrow than the wind blows
down a rocky mountain-peak.</p>

<p>“Now I declare to you that truth is an image clearly
to be seen only by the pure in heart. And those that
follow vain desires, imagine that truth is untruth and
see untruth in truth, and never arrive at truth. But
those whose aims are high, whose minds are unpolluted
with vanity, are able to distinguish between the false
and the true, and delight in truth. Therefore follow
not after vanity nor the enjoyment of lusts; for when
ye have known truth for yourselves, therein will ye
find great joy.</p>

<p>“Earnestness and meditation bring in their train
serenity and happiness. By earnestness did Indra
rise to the lordship of the gods. And he who delights
in sincerity, who looks with fear upon hypocrisy, moves
about like fire, burning all his fetters; and he that has
conquered himself by reflection, is close upon Nirvana.</p>

<p>“I would speak with you also concerning the tyranny
of passion. For as rain breaks through an ill-thatched
house, so passion breaks through the unfortified mind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Therefore it is necessary carefully to train the mind,
which is difficult to check and constantly rebellious,
rushing where it listeth. Yet, only a trained mind will
bring happiness. Let the wise man guard his thoughts,
lest the torrent of passion, rushing upon him, overwhelm
him in its depths. The mind travels far, moves
about alone, without a body; and, to be freed from
Mara, must often hide in the chamber of the heart.
But so long as man is under the bondage of passion, so
long is he exposed to the persuasions of Mara. And
so long as the desire of man toward woman, even the
smallest, is not destroyed, so long is his mind in bondage.
Thou shalt also cut out the love of thyself with
thine own hand; for it is the greatest tree in the forest
of dangers. From its root springs desire. Its foliage
is wanton. From lust spring fear and grief; but he
who is free from lust knows not grief nor fear. Yet no
man can free another from these things. As by one’s
self the evil is done, so by one’s self is one purified. Is
the struggle long? Is it lonely? Is it exceedingly
difficult? Fear not. By such measures only is serenity
attained. Well-makers lead the water where they
will. Fletchers bend the arrow; carpenters split a log
of wood; but a good man doeth the greatest thing of
all, for he can fashion himself.”</p>

<p>Hushka concluded his discourse quietly, with a
benign smile flickering from his eyes and just touching
his lips. The holy law that he preached to men
never failed to affect himself, and to uplift him. And
this, probably, was the secret of his power. Certainly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
if it took some courage nowadays to preach the word of
the Buddha in India, the preacher found his reward;
for his audiences were held fairly spellbound during
the ten or fifteen minutes of the discourse; and, under
the magic smoothness of the golden voice, the disjointed
nature of his preachment had passed unnoticed.
After a moment or two of silence, more complimentary
than any applause, the little throng began to break up,
and, five minutes later, the noise of the market-place
was as deafening as before. The Bhikkhu, his work
here finished, was turning to depart, when he perceived
his companion of the noontide still standing near,
apparently watching a chance to speak to him again.
Hushka gazed at him inquiringly, and Oman came up,
but stood silent and a little confused before him.</p>

<p>“Is there any service that I can perform for thee?”
asked Hushka, after regarding him for a moment
attentively.</p>

<p>Oman again gazed deep into the large, gentle eyes;
and with the look, a thrill of joy ran through him.
“Tell me, if you will, O Bhikkhu, if your order practises
this Dharma? Are all Buddhist brethren free
from desire and from the pain of discontent?”</p>

<p>“It is our endeavor thus to free ourselves. We follow
the teachings of the great Master.”</p>

<p>“Sramana-Gautama?”</p>

<p>The Bhikkhu bowed his head.</p>

<p>“There are many Jainists that come here, saying
that they also worship the Buddha truly—”</p>

<p>“Jainists! Hypocrites!” for an instant, Hushka’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
eyes flashed fire; but he pressed his lips tightly together,
and when he spoke again it was quite calmly:
“The Jainists are false Buddhists. The world has
been sadly overrun with hypocrisy; and they have been
its devotees. They do not follow Buddha, but Buddhaghosa;
and their law is not our law, for they do not
possess the manuscripts of truth.”</p>

<p>Oman nodded, and there was a pause. Then the
youth, his heart beating rapidly, his throat quite dry,
asked: “What is required of those that would join
your order?”</p>

<p>Hushka looked at him penetratingly, and said:
“Come. Let us proceed out of ear-shot of this tumult,
where we may talk together in peace.”</p>

<p>Willingly Oman complied; nor did either speak again
till they were in one of the least frequented of the
village streets. Even then, Oman hesitated to begin.
He was in such an inward turmoil that he could not
think of words in which to express himself. After a
little waiting, Hushka spoke for him:</p>

<p>“You have asked me, young man, what is required
of one that wishes to join our order. I answer you
that nothing is required save the wish.”</p>

<p>“But Sudras—outcasts—the once-born—do you
accept these into the brotherhood?”</p>

<p>“In the eyes of the Sramana, any man and any
woman may attain to Arahatship.”</p>

<p>“Women! Then there is no caste among you?”</p>

<p>“Thus it is written in one of our sacred books: ‘A
man does not become a Brahmana by his family or by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
his birth. In whom there is truth and righteousness, he
is blessed, he is a Brahmana.’”</p>

<p>It was the first time that Oman had dreamed of such
a thing as a social order without caste; and the idea
was so overwhelming that for some moments he was
silent out of sheer amazement. All his preconceived
notions went whirling in his head while he strove to
adjust himself to this. Never, until this Bhikkhu had
spoken in the market-place, had he had any idea of a religion
built solely for the help of human frailty, and for
the consolation of human sorrow. Now, what a vista
was suddenly opened before him! Small wonder that
he shut his eyes to the first radiant flood of light.
That he could see anything at all of the possibilities
carried in Hushka’s words, was due to the fact of his
three years of bitter solitude and lonely meditation.
After a few moments, during which Hushka kept a
wise silence, Oman asked slowly, with a trembling that
betrayed itself on his very lips:</p>

<p>“Could—a weaver—a Vaisya—become one of
you? Could I become a Bhikkhu?”</p>

<p>“Art thou a weaver? I had thought thee Brahman
born.”</p>

<p>“That also is true. I was born a Brahman.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Oman was sick now with
dread of a next question,—that never came. Hushka
was turning certain matters rapidly over in his mind.
From the first, Oman’s intense interest in his words had
been a mystery to him. Converts to Buddhism were
seldom made, in this day. It was now most rarely that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
the Bhikkhus brought novices back with them for the
Vassa; and the few that came were almost always of
Sudra caste. Oman, on the other hand, was apparently
of high breeding; and only some unusual fact could
have brought him into his present situation. Hushka
scented some misdeed, crime, perhaps, that had put the
youth into present bad standing. But the misdeed of
a Brahman was no Buddhist’s affair. To make him a
convert was the chief consideration; for had not the
great Buddha received into his order men of dark past?
There was excellent precedent for what Hushka wished
to do.</p>

<p>Later in his companionship with Oman, Hushka’s
first suspicion of crime was completely laid by the
openness of his pupil’s behavior. But, in justice to
the Bhikkhu be it said, he had never, until the end,
the faintest suspicion of the real nature of Oman’s
trouble.</p>

<p>Many thoughts and much reasoning passed rapidly
through Hushka’s mind; and then he turned again to
the youth, and said to him: “Thou hast asked me if
thou canst become a Bhikkhu. I answer thee—yes.
But first you must know something of our lives, and
the purpose of them. Then, understanding all that is
to be renounced, if you would still join us, I will myself
give you the first ordination, the Pabbagga, and
will take you as my pupil. I will be your master, your
Upagghaya; for I have instructed many youths through
their novitiate. Later, you will be given the second,
the highest ordination, Upasampada, and so become a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
Bhikkhu. But first you must understand whither I
would lead you.”</p>

<p>“Tell me! Tell me,” besought Oman, looking into
Hushka’s eyes, before whose steady orbs his own suddenly
fell.</p>

<p>And so, while they walked, the Buddhist expounded
to the lonely youth the simple doctrines of the great
religion: the renunciation of desire, of pleasure, of indulgence
in the flesh, and the growth of that serenity
that leads gradually to Nirvana, the great extinction.
And the plan of it all, the eightfold abstinence, the
fourfold path, seemed to Oman a perfect conception.
The whole doctrine was, to his troubled soul, like balm
on a deep wound, a draught of water to one perishing
in the desert. And in his delight, he was freed from
traditional prejudice, and gave himself up entirely to
the new companionship.</p>

<p>Thus, through the whole afternoon, the two walked
together, communing, until, as the sun slipped under
the western horizon, they paused once more before the
house of Gokarna. Hushka had reminded the young
man that his father and mother must be told of his
wish to become a Buddhist. Indeed, in the depths of
his quiet mind, the Bhikkhu apprehended insuperable
difficulty here, yet knew that the matter must be
faced; and he let Oman decide the manner of its
presentation. To Hushka’s astonishment, Oman took
it unquestioningly on himself, asking Hushka to wait
in the veranda while he went within to inform his
parents, or, in case Gokarna were absent, at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
his mother, of his great decision. Hushka made no
protest, nor suggested his own fitness to give a favorable
impression concerning the Bhikkhu’s life. Remembering
Oman’s new-born enthusiasm and seeing
in him no sign of nervousness about approaching his
guardians, Hushka reflected that Oman might have been
divinely fitted for this task. So, after a short colloquy
at the veranda step, the monk sat down in the vine-covered
retreat, and Oman went on into the house,
where, contrary to his expectation, he found both his
father and his mother.</p>

<p>For a long time Hushka sat there in the falling
night, cross-legged, in the manner of the Sakyamuni,
his hands on his knees, his head resting against the
wall of the house, meditating. And while he indulged
himself in hope, there came, through the open doorway,
the low, monotonous murmur of voices. They were
never raised above the ordinary pitch; and this Hushka
perceived with increasing satisfaction. Once or twice
there were to be heard a woman’s tones, followed
always by the musical voice of Oman, and the heavier
baritone of Gokarna. But the discussion, if discussion
there were, was carried on in an entirely matter-of-fact
manner.</p>

<p>During this time, outside, the hands of Nature had
been at work, and now the whole sky was robed in
luminous, fleecy gray, strewn with white stars, and
crowned with the radiant half-moon, which shed silver
beams over the whole earth. The air was warm and
fragrant with the breath of spring. It was a night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
when the very atmosphere brought intoxication. And
gradually the expression of him sitting alone in the
veranda changed, and grew very sad; and a new light,
one of sorrow and yearning, shone in the depths of his
large eyes.</p>

<p>Now the murmur of voices inside the house ceased.
Oman’s task was accomplished. After a moment of
silence the three came out of the firelit room, into
the cool and shadowy veranda. It was a second or
two before any one of them could see Hushka, who
had risen, and slowly moved forward to them. Then
Gokarna also advanced, and spoke:</p>

<p>“O Bhikkhu, Oman, my son, has told me that
which my heart is sad to hear. He wishes to receive
from you Buddhist ordination and go forth as
your pupil.”</p>

<p>Hushka bent his head once. “That is true. The
young man came to me after I had discoursed upon
the Dharma in the market-place, and asked that he
might become my Saddhiviharika, to listen daily to the
Dharma and become versed in the way of the great life.”</p>

<p>“So says my son; and, O Bhikkhu, so fervently
doth he desire to enter upon this life, that he hath
won consent from us. So I bid you take him for a
pupil, and treat him with that forbearance that is a
law of all religions.”</p>

<p>Hushka bent his head again. “Let it be thus,” he
said solemnly.</p>

<p>There was a stifled sob from Kota, who stood in the
background, behind her husband; and then Oman, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
had embraced her, went forward to his master, asking:
“When shall I receive the ordination?”</p>

<p>“When thou wilt. Any time is a proper time for
the Pabbagga.”</p>

<p>“Then let me be at once ordained, that we may set
forth at an early hour on the morrow.”</p>

<p>“Come then into the moonlight here before the step,
that each may look upon the face of the other. Yet,”—he
glanced toward Kota and Gokarna, who still
stood close at hand,—“yet we should not act in the
presence of any but followers of Gautama.”</p>

<p>At this, the father and mother embraced Oman, and
then, when Kota had murmured to him that she
should see him again in the morning, the two retired
for the night, leaving Oman and Hushka alone in the
veranda. Hushka was struggling with the bundle on
his back, which Oman helped him to remove. In it,
wrapped in the mat used by Buddhists for many purposes,
lay a set of yellow robes, apparently new, yet
mudstained to a height of a foot above the hem.</p>

<p>“Whence come the stains? And how dost thou
carry this set of garments?” queried Oman, delighted
that he was at once to assume the dress of his new
faith.</p>

<p>“Thus is it decreed that, in such emergencies as
this, when we take a pupil, we should have a robe
for him. And the robes are stained with earth, that
no Bhikkhu or student shall vainly rejoice in his new
garment.”</p>

<p>Laying aside the yellow robes, Hushka bound up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
his mat again, this time putting the little bundle to one
side, on the veranda. Then he said to Oman:</p>

<p>“Now must thou don this garb. It is our rule
that the brethren shall not look upon one another
in the act of robing or disrobing; so I turn my face
from thee. Yet it will be necessary that I show thee
the required manner of passing the cloth about the
upper part of the body and over the left shoulder.
Therefore, when the skirt is adjusted, call me to thine
assistance.”</p>

<p>Oman nodded; but, as Hushka turned toward the
other end of the veranda, Oman, who, in loosening
his usual tunic, had accidentally touched the cord that
he always wore, called out to Hushka: “The cord—the
Brahman cord—must it be put off?”</p>

<p>“Let it remain,” answered Hushka, without turning
around; and Oman in his heart rejoiced.</p>

<p>When he was dressed and Hushka had taught him the
trick of fastening the end of the yellow cloth under his
arm, Oman declared himself ready for the ordination.
Thereupon Hushka, in a solemn tone, once more repeated
to him the laws of abstinence for a novice;
and then, Oman having faithfully promised to observe
them all, Hushka bade him sit down, cross-legged,
somewhat after the manner of a Yogi, and, when he
had raised his clasped hands to a level with his eyes,
caused him to repeat slowly, three times, these words:</p>

<p>“I take my refuge in the Buddha. I take my refuge
in the Dharma. I take my refuge in the Samgha (the
community of brethren).”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>This said, Oman repeated after his preceptor the
creed that he had heard for the first time that morning:
“Of all things proceeding from cause, their causes hath
the Tathagata explained. The Great Sramana hath
likewise explained the causes of the cessation of existence.
Let him be forever worshipped.”</p>

<p>With these simple words, the ordination was completed;
but Oman still remained in the half-kneeling,
half-sitting position, motionless, silent, a little pale. It
was as if the repetition of the creed had wrought a
change in his whole being. He experienced an inexplicably
strong emotion, an emotion amazing to himself,
perhaps not so much so to Hushka, who stood looking
down on him with the silver moonlight in his gentle,
dark eyes. Oman found himself gazing into those
eyes as if they had been of the Buddha himself. After
a little, however, Hushka broke the spell, saying,
quietly:</p>

<p>“Come, my pupil, let us seek our rest. On the
morrow we must proceed upon our way.”</p>

<p>Oman rose at once, and followed his master to that
end of the veranda where he was wont to sleep. Here,
dressed as they were, the two lay down, some distance
apart, with no covering but their yellow garments and
the sweet night air. Very soon Hushka’s breath came
evenly and long; and the other knew that he slept.
But Oman closed his eyes in vain. He could not
sleep; nor, indeed, did he desire to. His heart was full.
It had come, at last, all that he had dreamed of. The
impossible was come to pass. On the morrow he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
going out into the world,—out into the broad, shining
world, in the companionship of a man that did not
scorn him, with a faith in his heart that he loved, that
loved him, that had been decreed for him and all the
scattered brethren of the lonely life.</p>

<small>YELLOW-ROBED</small></h3>
</div>


<p>The moon had set before Oman finally lost himself in
sleep. It seemed to him that an hour could not possibly
have passed when he felt a touch on his brow,
and, looking up, beheld Hushka bending over him.</p>

<p>“Up—up—my Saddhiviharika! The new day is
here. Let us renew our faith.”</p>

<p>Oman, sleepy and confused, rose, and, following his
master’s example, knelt on one knee, lifted both his
clasped hands, and repeated after Hushka the short
creed that he already knew by heart. Then the
Bhikkhu, rising, said:</p>

<p>“Let us now go and cleanse ourselves at a fountain.
Is that in the market-place the nearest?”</p>

<p>“No, my master. I will lead you to another, close
at hand.”</p>

<p>“Come, then. And, as we walk, see that thou
meditate upon this thought, which should now be with
thee constantly: the extermination of desire for earthly
things. For it is written in the book of the law:
‘Leaving all pleasures behind, calling nothing his own,
let the wise man purge himself of troubles of the
mind’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>It was a fair morning. The sun was not yet above
the horizon, but the whole eastern sky glowed fiery
crimson in the clear atmosphere. Gay bird-notes filled
the air; and a vagrant breeze shook the fragrance from
every jessamine and honeysuckle vine in Bul-Ruknu.
It was an ecstatic hour; and Hushka’s eyes were bright
with the beauty of it when he and Oman reached the
well. As the young man filled Hushka’s bowl with
water, he turned to his master and said:</p>

<p>“The day, sir, is very fair. Does the Dharma forbid
us to rejoice in the beauty of the dawn?”</p>

<p>Hushka lowered his eyes, and answered softly: “We
are told that the extinction of feeling is the most desirable
of all things. But, until that comes, I think it can
hurt no man to rejoice at the sight of a sunrise sky.”</p>

<p>Their ablutions over, the two returned to the house
of Gokarna, and found Kota standing in the veranda,
anxiously awaiting them. She had prepared two large
dishes of rice—a great luxury—and, as soon as they
came up, bade them sit and eat. Oman helped his
master to the fullest portion, and then ate his own from
the wooden bowl in which it had been prepared. This
dish Kota offered to her son, to be used for his alms;
and Hushka himself thanked her for the gift to his
pupil.</p>

<p>Oman, to his own surprise, found himself delaying
the meal out of sorrow at thought of leaving this home.
He had never in his life been more than twenty miles
from Bul-Ruknu. Now, very probably, he should
never see the town again: never again look on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
mother, his father, or any of the familiar people among
whom he had grown up. As he reflected on this, the
spoon dropped from his hand, and he bent his head,
conscious all the while that Hushka’s eyes were fixed
on him. He was blind with tears which he was struggling
furiously not to shed, when some one knelt beside
him, and he felt two twining arms around his neck, and
a long kiss on his cheek. A thrill ran through his
heart. With passionate grief he returned his mother’s
embrace. Then, breaking suddenly from her clasp, a
“Farewell!” choking in his throat, he ran out of the
veranda, down the street, and then halted, with
clenched hands, till Hushka should come.</p>

<p>Presently the Bhikkhu joined him, walking rapidly;
and Oman perceived that in his face there was no ridicule;
only a mute sympathy. He carried with him
the two bowls, each of which contained some rice
which, he explained, they would keep for their midday
meal. Oman took his own dish, asking to carry both,
which he was not permitted to do. Side by side they
went, through the narrow and ill-kept streets of the
town, till at length they came to its outer wall, and
passed out by the gate called after the street along
which they had come: the street which, outside of Bul-Ruknu,
became a public highway leading straight up
into the Vindhyas.</p>

<p>“Ah! Go we up into the hills?” asked Oman, a
note of joy in his voice.</p>

<p>“From now till we reach Bágh we shall be almost
constantly in the hills. And there are nearly three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
months of journeying before the Vassa<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> can be begun.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Vassa: the customary sojourn in Viharas, or monasteries, from
June to October.</p>

</div>

<p>“I am glad. The hills are a delight to me!”</p>

<p>But no sooner had this simple thought escaped
Oman’s lips, than he repented of it; for he imagined
that he should bring upon himself a text commending
the beauty of indifference to all things. But Hushka,
in the interval, had read his mind, and, smiling faintly,
said: “Be not afraid, Oman, that this religion will
take from thee all thy delights. Our lives, free from
care, free from dread of the morrow, of any concern
for to-day, free from loneliness or the burdens of poverty,
want, and suffering, are almost wholly without
pain; and this was the great wish of the Buddha.
We are taught to look charitably and kindly on all
living things, allowing each its place. And if, in our
hearts, we have cherished any evil thought toward any
man, we are allowed the relief of confessing it before
the assembled Samgha. This frame of mind is conducive
to the greatest serenity. And you, O Oman, will
find, in one year’s time, that your whole attitude of
mind is changed. You will regard meditation on holy
things, and the study of the Dharma, as the highest
privileges of life.”</p>

<p>Hushka paused, and Oman found in his words
enough food for thought to be glad of silence. They
proceeded for a long time without speech. And gradually,
as Oman came out of his revery, he found his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
spirits growing lighter. A sense of freedom had taken
possession of him; and now every step that increased
the distance between himself and the home of his unnatural
and unhappy youth, increased also his delight.</p>

<p>When the sun hung in mid-sky, and they had reached
the end of the first pass and stood in a little valley,
through which ran a stream of fresh water, the two sat
down to eat and take an hour’s rest. They seated
themselves on the thick grass, careful to disturb no
insect visible to the eye; and then, without any preliminary
grace or offering to any god, a matter as
natural to Oman as eating, began their meal. They
faced each other, and Hushka kept an eye on his pupil
to see that he transgressed none of those rules of polite
eating so minutely set forth in the <i>Kullavagga</i>. But
there was no fault to be found with the student on this
point. On the contrary, Oman ate as delicately as a
woman; and Hushka, after watching him for a moment
or two, exclaimed pleasantly:</p>

<p>“By the word of the Samgha, Oman, thou hast the
look as well as the way of a woman about thee,
sometimes.”</p>

<p>Oman lifted his head, a gleam of terror in his eyes.
“I am not a woman. How, then, should I resemble
one?” he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>Hushka, still contemplating him, smiled, but did not
answer the question. Then Oman, distressed and angry,
sprang to his feet, and began to pace up and down the
bank of the stream; and it was five minutes before he
could return to his meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>At this time of his life, perhaps what Hushka said
about Oman’s appearance was more or less true. His
slender figure, dreaming dark eyes, face guiltless of
any beard, and hair flowing to his shoulders, might,
indeed, have belonged to a woman of high caste. But
there was also something about him that was decisively
masculine:—whether his manner of carrying himself,
the habit of looking any one piercingly in the eye, or
his taciturnity, it would be hard to say. But it is
very certain that the mingling of two elements in
him had produced no weak and vacillating creature,
of meagre intellect and silly tongue. Freed from the
unhappy surroundings of his youth, Oman was likely
henceforth to command both interest and respect;
and Hushka’s foregoing remark had been nothing
more than a thoughtless and haphazard jest.</p>

<p>Oman recovered himself before he sat down again;
and, his rice finished, he washed both bowls, and dried
them with leaves. Then he rose, supposing that they
were to proceed. It seemed, however, that this was
the hour for meditation. In imitation of the Sramana,
who was wont to sit in concentrated thought
for days at a time at the foot of some forest tree,
Hushka and his pupil, obeying one of the few rules
of “hours,” seated themselves, cross-legged, under different
trees, and remained there for a long time, motionless,
wrapped in contemplation of Nirvâna—the bliss of
emancipation. It was the first time that Oman had
ever performed this especial act of worship, which
is common to all the higher Indian religions. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
found it more interesting than he had imagined it
could be; and was glad to think that, at Bágh, much
of it would be required in his studies.</p>

<p>By two o’clock the wanderers were on their way
again, and Hushka told his pupil where they were to
pass the night. Some miles farther on, in a valley,
was a large banyan grove, inhabited by hermits of
various sects, among whom were half a dozen Buddhists,
who passed their lives in rigid asceticism, but
had abandoned the routine of pilgrimage and Vassa.</p>

<p>For a long time they proceeded on their way, following
the track of the sun into the southwest, each
wrapped in his own thoughts. Then Oman, as much
out of desire to listen to Hushka’s melodious voice as
to learn something of the Being both were worshipping,
began to question his master concerning the holy life.
And Hushka, taking up his duty, recited to his companion
the history of the life of Gautama Sramana,
from the hour of his birth in the forest of Kapila-Vastu,
until that of his death in the forest of Tirhut,
where he fell back into the arms of his disciples, murmuring:
“I am exhorting you for the last time.
Transitory things are perishable. Without delay,
qualify yourselves for Nirvâna.”</p>

<p>The life-story, told simply, but with an eloquence
born of reverent love, moved Oman powerfully. Here,
indeed, was a man!—a man who had lived a comprehensible
life and had died naturally. To his mind, crammed
with legendary tales of Vedic demigods and monsters,
with all their meaningless miracles and overinterpreted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
allegorical deeds, there was something in this remarkable,
but perfectly credible history, that brought conviction
of the truth of the Buddha’s doctrines. The
life he had lived was enviable. Evidently he had
seen clearly from the very beginning; had known his
course and had run it, gathering strength as he went
on. True, the Buddha had been born into honor and
riches, and had never had the terrible struggles of loneliness
forced on him. But he had chosen these for
himself; and he had voluntarily made himself outcast
from men.</p>

<p>These musings occupied Oman till the sun was setting
on their first day’s journey. They were now
descending the slope that led into the valley of the
banyan tree. When they reached its level, and could
look down the long aisle of trunks into the green twilight
of this natural temple, Oman felt a throb of
pleasure, as one at home. They entered in silence, and
had not walked far before the light of a fire became
visible among the trees in the distance. Thither
they bent their steps, and, reaching it, found that
it burned before the entrance of a small building, built
around the tree trunks. Beside this shrine and before
the fire were half a dozen naked men, their black hair
wild and dishevelled, their bodies caked with dirt and
disfigured with scars of flagellation.</p>

<p>“These are Agivakas. We do not stop here,” murmured
Hushka, as they approached.</p>

<p>Oman looked at the repulsive creatures curiously.
They were passed, however, without any salutation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
with not even a look, so far as the ascetics were concerned;
and presently the yellow-robed were out of
sight of their dancing fire. The green interior of the
grove was now nearly dark. Hushka quickened his
steps; and Oman, spent though he was with unwonted
exercise, followed bravely, knowing that they must reach
protection that night, since to sleep in the open, in this
mountain region, was a danger not lightly to be undergone.
However, further firelight among the trees
presently reached them, and they proceeded with new
heart, soon arriving at the Buddhist retreat. Here
was no temple. Five tonsured men, clean-shaven, clad
in worn yellow robes, sat round their fire, partaking of
a supper of millet-seed and water. This meal the
Upagghaya and his pupil received a cordial invitation
to join; and it was taken for granted that
they would also sleep there. To Oman, weary as he
was, the mere fact of eating, of being near a shining
fire, of seeing around him friendly faces, of listening
to talk from which he was not excluded, brought an
almost overpowering sense of happiness. Here was
such companionship as he had not known since his
baby days. Here were no curious, repellent eyes
upon him. And, suddenly, the feminine in him rose,
bringing to his eyes tears which it took all his angry
self-control to keep from falling.</p>

<p>That night Oman slept the sweet sleep of healthy
fatigue; but he wakened early, and in a new world.
The fire had died. Far overhead the first glimmer of
dawn shone down in a veil of translucent, deep green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
light—like the light in the sea. The air was vibrating
softly with the twittering chorus of myriad birds
that made their home in the banyan tree. Otherwise,
there was a great, morning silence. Oman, drowsy,
and unwilling to move, lay like one in a trance, looking,
listening, wondering, at the beauty around him.
Presently it was transformed. Every one was awake,
and up and moving about; but the past half hour lay
deep in his heart, and the pureness of it remained with
him always.</p>

<p>The morning repast was hastier than had been that
of the evening; and about sunrise the pilgrims, after
many good wishes and farewells from those they were
leaving, set forth again on their way. This time they
took no food with them in their bowls; for in the early
afternoon they should reach a mountain village where,
after Hushka had preached in the bazaar, they were
sure to obtain at least one meal. This morning’s walk
was difficult, for it lay steadily uphill. Hushka, however,
kept the mind of his pupil too much occupied for
him to feel the weariness of the road. The master
talked to him of religion, explained the canon of
Buddhist law in its simple form, and repeated long
passages from holy books. Oman listened intently to
everything. His new religion delighted him anew.
The laws that he heard seemed to him divinely wise,
so well were they adapted to human weakness. And
all the time, in his subconsciousness, he had another
joy: that to-day he should again hear Hushka
speak to many people. The Bhikkhu’s conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
was precious; but Oman, thirsting for a broader triumph,
was waiting to watch his magnetism again gather
up an antagonistic audience and draw them to his feet.</p>

<p>And Oman came to taste the fulness of this delight;
for, wherever they went, success followed Hushka’s
preaching. What it was—the expression of his great
eyes, the low, musical, leisurely tones of his admirably
managed voice, or perhaps just the words he spoke—his
pupil could not determine: probably a measure of
all three. At any rate, even in this day of the fall
of the great faith, in many towns from Bágh to Dhár
and even farther to the north, the annual coming of
the Bhikkhu Hushka was awaited as an event; and
where he stopped for the first time, he was remembered
with delight, and his return hoped for. Nor,
after one of his discourses, was there to be found even
a Brahman, that had heard him, who had anything
but words of praise for his eloquence.</p>

<p>March passed away and April followed, and still the
two fought their way through the mighty hills, surrounded
by possible dangers, but encountering none.
The days were growing hot; and, when the moon
was full they sometimes travelled by night, but this
not often, because of the wild creatures that loved
to roam abroad during the quiet hours. The time
passed too quickly. Oman, now inured to constant exercise,
throve on it and grew strong. His limbs began
to show muscle, and his body renewed its vigor, till he
looked a straight and handsome youth. And as his
physique developed, so also his mind. Hushka never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
ceased his instructions in the Dharma, nor did Oman
fail to treasure his master’s lightest precept. He was
familiar now with what lay before him during the
Vassa season. He learned the mode of daily life;
the rules of procedure in the Samgha, or community of
brethren; and also the ritual of the general confession,
the Patimokkha, held fortnightly, on new and full
moon days during the Vassa. But the multitude and
minuteness of the laws, and the petty tyranny they
exercised, remained happily unguessed by him; for
Hushka was too wise to burden his mind in the beginning
with what would soon become a natural part
of existence.</p>

<p>Oman’s present life was beautiful to him. The magnificence
of the scenery amid which they lived, the
season of the year, when the earth was at its height
of joy, still more, perhaps, the beautiful influence of
Hushka’s companionship and the spirituality of what
he taught, combined to waken in Oman a buoyancy of
spirit, a sense of hope and of ideality, that furnished
him strength to sustain the years of bitter tribulation
and trial that were still to be his.</p>

<p>At length one day Oman and Hushka, side by side,
staves in hand, reached the treeless summit of a high
hill, up the side of which they had toiled throughout
the morning, Hushka for a purpose, Oman following
unquestioningly. When they stood upon the crest,
there spread before them a mighty prospect, fair and
far-reaching in the clear light of noon. In the distance,
a mere sinuous, sparkling thread, was a river,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
bordered by a strip of green plain. Nearer yet, a
deep-hued patch of foliage marked a jungle, dwindled
by height and distance. Then came foothills, curving
round and out, like a rough causeway, toward that fast-flowing
river; and, in the midst of rocky cliffs and
sudden tufts of foliage, were to be seen the low roofs
and white walls of many buildings.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Hushka, gently: “yonder is Bágh.
Our pilgrimage is over. We have crossed the Vindhyas.
June is here, and it is the Vassa season. Art
thou ready, Oman?” And he turned to examine his
pupil’s face.</p>

<p>Oman neither spoke nor answered the look. He
was beyond himself. Suddenly, out of the dark fastnesses
of the past, shot a gleam of light. A new vista
was opening before his eyes. Memory—fleeting, evanescent—hovered
over him. His mind was struggling
to penetrate the land of forgetfulness. The gates
seemed still barred; and yet—here was a key. That
river—that shining river, yonder, in the light—he
knew it well,—so well that he was shuddering at
sight of it.</p>

<p>“Oman,” repeated Hushka, disturbed at the look in
his pupil’s eyes.</p>

<p>With that one word, the dream broke. Oman turned
sharply, stared for a second into his Master’s face, and
then, in a voice of the far away, answered: “Yes, I
am ready, master. Let us descend. Let us enter the
Vihara of Truth.”</p>

<small>THE VIHARA OF TRUTH</small></h3>
</div>


<p>The town of Bágh, begun in a little valley, had
gradually spread, up an open hillside looking toward
the southeast, and over and beyond the jungle, to
the Narmáda plain. The great Viharas were two or
three miles south of the village, built, all nine of them,
in the flat of a ravine, with wooded hillsides rising
abruptly on either side. It was not until the morning
after their view from the hilltop that Hushka and
Oman made their appearance here. They had arrived
in Bágh at dusk the evening before, unusually wearied
by an unusual day’s toil. Now, after passing the
night in Bágh, they had come, in the glow of a June
morning, fiercely hot, but filled with that glorifying
sense of summer that cannot be burnt away even by
the deadly rays of an Indian sun, to begin the Vassa
season.</p>

<p>Along the path from the town, and through the
ravine itself, they met with what seemed to Oman,
brought up to regard Buddhism as a dead faith, a surprising
number of Bhikkhus, all, apparently, like themselves,
returning from the pilgrimage. And Oman
further wondered by what feat of perfect calculation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
they had managed to arrive from their wanderings on
this particular day. As a matter of fact, some that
they passed had been in the neighborhood for a week
or more; and others would continue to arrive through
the next week. There were perhaps a hundred and
fifty men in all, including fourteen or fifteen novices;
and there were few here who could remember a time
when there had been more in the valley. Yet tradition
told a great tale. For, whereas now, all these men
lived in a single Vihara, the last in the row of the
great buildings, in the days of the past every one of
the nine huge monasteries had been filled to overflowing,
and twenty-five hundred men had passed their
Vassa in the ravine.</p>

<p>Happily, to-day, none cared to dwell on the memory
of old glories. The Brethren were all busy greeting
one another, and giving hasty account of incidents
of their various pilgrimages; for, through the winter
months, the Buddhists of Bágh were scattered over all
Malwa, as far north as Rajputana, and southward,
through the plains, nearly to the great ghats. Hushka
was never alone, for he was one of the most important
and also one of the most popular monks of
the Samgha. Oman, indeed, following at his master’s
heels, felt aggrieved and neglected. He occupied
himself in observation, finding high cause for wonder
in the vast, empty buildings lining the valley. They
were immensely long, narrow for their width, and built
entirely of stone cut from the great quarries near
the river. Their verandas were wide, roofed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
pillared with stone; but the shade-mats of straw had
long since rotted and fallen away, and the interior of
the mighty monuments stood open and empty, deserted
by their builders and their faith.</p>

<p>Gradually the two approached the last of the line of
monasteries, which, as Hushka had told him, was called
the Vihara of Truth, and was the only one still inhabited.
This place presented a very different appearance
from that of its silent neighbors. As they came near
the central doorway, Hushka left off his conversation
with a friend, and turned to Oman. Taking him by
the hand, he led him up the step, to the spot where
stood a large man, wearing a white cloak over his
yellow robes, and further marked by an air of extreme
dignity and condescension. Oman had observed his
statuesque figure some moments previously, and saw
that, though he never moved from his place, every
Bhikkhu that approached made haste to go to him, to
bow and receive his greeting.</p>

<p>“That is the Sugata, the master of the Vihara, who
has almost attained to Arahatship, and remains in meditation
throughout the period of pilgrimage,” murmured
Hushka in Oman’s ear, just before they reached the
great man.</p>

<p>Oman felt a thrill of reverence, and looked again,
hoping to perceive new marks of holiness. All that his
eyes could see, however, was a tall, stout person, with
a round, benign-looking face, plump and smooth-shaven.
The Sugata was smiling, and Oman, hungrily as he
searched, could find in that countenance no traces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
divine spirituality. However, the great One’s eight
months of meditation seemed to have agreed with him
uncommonly well.</p>

<p>Before this irreverent thought had taken root in
Oman’s mind, he was led up by Hushka and presented
to the mighty one as a Saddhiviharika who had received
first ordination three months before. The Sugata
fixed his eyes upon the young man, who ingenuously
returned the look, as the master addressed Hushka:</p>

<p>“He appears young. Is he of age?”</p>

<p>“Of eighteen years, sir.”</p>

<p>“Let him study well the Dharma, that, in a year, he
may receive Upasampada.”</p>

<p>With this, Oman’s audience appeared to be at an
end; and, a little relieved to be out of the neighborhood
of such holiness, he followed Hushka across the
veranda to a square, arcaded cloister, where, directly in
front of the entrance, stood a man with an open bag
before him, containing coins. Hushka took from his
girdle the alms-purse that he had worn for eight months,
and emptied its contents into the receptacle, at the same
time exchanging greetings with the almoner. Oman,
looking on, understood that it was upon this money,
received on the pilgrimages, that the Bhikkhus lived
in their monastery through the Vassa season.</p>

<p>Hushka’s exchange of courtesies ended in the question
as to where he should find one Mahapra. Informed that
he was in the Uposatha hall, the monk went back, Oman
still at his side, and, passing into the veranda again,
turned down it to the right, and, some distance farther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
on, entered a room so vast that Oman stopped upon its
threshold, staring. Here, near the door, was gathered
quite a throng, engaged in lively altercation with one
of their number, whose lean face wore a perturbed and
strained look. At sight of him Hushka began to
laugh.</p>

<p>“It is, this year, Mahapra’s lot to assign the cells,”
he explained to Oman. And, leaving the young man
where he was, Hushka himself plunged into the crowd.</p>

<p>So long a time elapsed before he emerged, that
Oman, tired and bewildered by so much that was new,
squatted down on the floor, to the left of the entrance,
to wait. Finally Hushka returned to him, a look of
satisfaction on his face; and, signing Oman to follow,
walked rapidly across the hall, through a small door at
the end into the cloister, across this open space, and
finally down a narrow passage that ended in another
open square surrounded by small doors. Here Hushka
stopped, looking round him till he found a door inscribed
with a certain letter. This he threw open.</p>

<p>“Behold, Oman,” said he, “here is your home. This
is the square of novices, and I have got you a cell with
an outer window. It will be well that you should
remain here for a time. The Vihara will be all confusion
to-day. But, if you come forth, do not forget the
letter of your door.”</p>

<p>Then, without further ado, Hushka turned and hurried
away, having himself much to accomplish before
nightfall. Oman, peremptorily left alone, looked
around him, at his new abiding-place. The room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
was extremely small, considering the size of the Vihara.
Opposite the door was a small window, with a straw
shade rolled up from it and bound round with a
string. From the window could be seen a strip of hillside,
where the light of noon glared over shadowless
gray earth, dotted here and there with clumps of
stunted bushes. This, with a bit of deep blue sky,
was his view. The furniture of the room consisted of
a straw bed with a sleeping-mat, an earthen water-jug,
another jar, and, under the window, on a low, stone
platform a foot square, a small bronze image of the
Buddha. The stone walls of the cell were nearly covered
with carvings and bright-colored frescoes, which,
crude as they were, gave the room an air of comfort
and furnishing.</p>

<p>Oman, accustomed to absolute simplicity, looked
around him highly satisfied with his dwelling-place.
He was not, however, so well pleased at the prospect
of spending the whole afternoon without food;
for his breakfast had been scanty, and the morning
long. Nevertheless, Hushka had bidden him remain
here, and Hushka’s slightest wish was law. So, calling
up some of the Vedic fortitude of his childhood’s
fasts, he remained for an hour or more gazing out of
the window, considering some of the features of the new
life; and then, since there seemed nothing better to do,
let down the curtain over his window, threw himself
upon his bed, and, in a few moments, had lost himself
in sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first week of the Vassa life passed without
order, in a jumbling way. Then, suddenly, as if by
magic, everything changed, and existence ran as if by
clockwork. Without knowing how it had all come
about, the novices found their studies begun, and
perceived that they were living under stringent laws.
Only Oman, among the twenty youths that had received
the Pabbagga ordination, found nothing to chafe
him in the rules of the day, which were enforced with
a rigor that defied disobedience. It was a long time,
indeed, before the young Brahman, occupied with the
unusual joys of companionship and congenial work,
awoke to the fact of how much was being accomplished
by himself and by those around him.</p>

<p>At dawn—which was early enough at this time of
year—the whole Vihara was roused by the clanging
of a bell, which rang till the most persistent sleeper
could no longer retain his drowsiness. Then monks
and novices alike made the prescribed ablutions and
put on the outer robe. After this came half an hour of
meditation, each one sitting alone in his open cell, while
masters of the day passed through the corridors at
irregular intervals to make sure that meditation did
not lapse into sleep. This over, the whole company
repaired to the Uposatha hall, and, seating themselves
on the floor in orderly rows, repeated in concert the
creed and prayers for the day. Now came a scramble
to the refectory, where a meal was served:—a meal
such as could scarcely have been duplicated in any
Rajah’s palace. For if the Bhikkhus were accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
to begin the Vassa with yellow robes hanging on their
emaciated frames, they were sure of setting forth on
their pilgrimage in October well fortified for the rigors
of the fasting season.</p>

<p>The morning meal at an end, monks and novices
separated, and the succeeding hours were occupied with
varying tasks. The novices repaired to the smaller
audience hall, where they were taken in charge by one
of the four masters. Squatting in an orderly row
on the floor, they listened in decorous silence to the
reading of passages of the law, and then to a long
lecture expounding all that had been read, with paraphrases
by certain of the more notable commentators.
This ordinarily occupied from two to three hours,
after which followed lessons in the Dharma, the novices
themselves being called upon to interpret chapters previously
learned by rote. Then came a period of silent
contemplation of the longed-for state: the cessation of
desire and the extinction of feeling. This over, the
second meal was served, and after it came relaxation,
the novices being allowed to watch the distribution of the
remains of the meal among the poor of the village who,
at this hour, came crowding to the Vihara gates. This
was the one period of unrestrained liberty in the day;
and novices were permitted to indulge themselves in
games and amusements forbidden to the doubly ordained.</p>

<p>By three o’clock this was over; and the two following
hours were spent in the library, in the perusal of sacred
manuscripts, of which the Vihara of Truth owned a
large number. Of all the day’s occupations this was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
to Oman, the most deeply engrossing. He had a great
advantage over most of his companions, in being able to
read easily both in Sanscrit and the older Pâli; for the
scholarship of his youth had not left him. The working
day was ended by the most difficult task of all:—three
hours of silent meditation on some tenet
announced at the time. At first, to those unaccustomed
to it, these three hours seemed as long as the
eight months of the Sugata’s retirement; and the
novices whispered, and yawned, and eyed each other,
and let their minds wander, till the length of their
penances became startling. But gradually the time
seemed shorter, the habit of abstract thought more
fixed, until it was sometimes a surprise to hear the
great bell ringing out the close of day, when all save
penitents were commended to seek a needed rest.</p>

<p>This daily program was varied every two weeks, on
Uposatha days, by the ceremony of the recitation of
the Patimokkha; which meant the reading of lists of
misdeeds punishable, the special penance for each
offence, and, finally, a general confession and fixing of
penances. The whole thing usually lasted from six to
eight hours, and was very tiresome. But the remainder
of the day was a holiday, when rules were abandoned,
and monks and novices allowed to mix indiscriminately.</p>

<p>Such was the outline of Vihara life, which, in the
beginning of the thirteenth century, differed little
from that maintained in the first Buddhist monastery
eighteen hundred years before. The circumstances of
the day were unvaried; but the details, for the individuals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
living the life, were never the same. The
occupations held infinite possibilities, being perfectly
adaptable to moods. The meditation that one day
seemed to stretch out into infinity, passed rapidly on
the next. If the incidents of the life of Gautama set
forth in one day’s reading were dull and dreary, on the
next the excerpt might sound like a fairy story, and the
reading-hour prove all too short. For those of dull,
phlegmatic temperament, perhaps there was not, after
all, much difference. But Oman Ramasarman was
everything but phlegmatic. A creature of strange
moods, stirred by many feelings incomprehensible to
the multitude, devoted to the working out of a mighty
expiation, as unknown to himself as it was to his companions,
his four months of Vihara life were a momentous
period with him. He very soon came to an understanding
of what this wisely regulated existence might
hold for him. He perceived that here he might build
a foundation for that resignation to the actual that
he needed so terribly to attain; and forthwith he set
himself, with all the determination of which he was
capable, to attain to a full appreciation of the worth of
the Buddhist teaching.</p>

<p>From the books of his religion Oman extracted much
food for thought, on which he dwelt during the hours
of meditation. From the very first, these periods of
silence had been pregnant. In them, now, he found
answers to his infinite, unasked questions. They, first
of all, had awakened him to the import of the days.
Perhaps, since Gautama’s first conceptions of his great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
creed, there had been no proselyte so apt for the faith
as this poor, bewildered subject of a pitiless judgment.
Within Oman’s body two natures, both human, both filled
with direst cravings of humanity, had long struggled for
supremacy. Now he had been removed from the old
life, where he beheld sense worshipped on every side,
and found himself in a community which taught, as an
inviolable law, the renunciation of all sense gratification
as the only road to happiness. A sudden austerity,
born of the brain, began to work in Oman’s heart.
Self-denial and abnegation became a passion with him.
It was with deep delight that he graved upon his mind
such verses as these:</p>

<p>“That middle path of knowledge which the Tathagata
has gained, which leads to wisdom and conduces
to calm, is the holy eightfold path: right belief, right
aspiration, right speech, right conduct, right means of
livelihood, right endeavor, right memory, right meditation.
This is the path that conduces to Nirvâna.”</p>

<p>“And this is the noble truth of suffering: birth is
suffering, decay is suffering, illness is suffering, death
is suffering. Presence of objects we hate, separation
from objects we love, not to obtain what we desire—all
these are suffering. Briefly, the clinging to existence
is suffering.”</p>

<p>“Now hear the truth of the cessation of suffering:
it will cease with the cessation of thirst—a cessation
which consists in the abandonment of every passion.
With deliverance from this thirst comes the destruction
of desire, the cessation of suffering.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>This was the subject on which, in his hours of contemplation,
Oman insistently dwelt. In his heart he
knew that here lay his help; and he felt it no wrong
that he clung to one topic, disregarding many of the
others prescribed. The process of enforced and long-continued
meditation is a curious thing, and productive
of strange results. Thought is hardly governable, as
volatile as a gas; and to keep it fixed for any length
of time upon a single point, requires a power difficult
of attainment. When it is gained, however, and then
persistently made use of, the character of the thinker is
sure to change in one of several ways; and it is axiomatic
that, in a meditative community, the individuals
are never quite normal.</p>

<p>In Oman’s case, the effect of the silent hours, which
began to be visible after two months of Vihara life, was
one of increasing dignity and age. He had entered the
Vihara a youth, of extremely boyish appearance, with
shyest manners. He had been thoroughly crude, and
so awkward before older men that he had given an
early impression of stupidity. Now all this was altered.
He was quiet, grave-eyed, thoughtful-looking; but his
manner, filled with self-control, was almost impressive.
His grasp of the teachings of the Dharma had been quick,
his questions keen and pointed. Moreover, during the
periods of relaxation, he began to keep himself apart
from his fellows, but was often to be seen talking with
his master, Hushka, or some one of the older monks of
Hushka’s faction. And it was among the novices, who
began to look up to him, that the idea first originated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
that Oman was to receive his Upasampada at the end
of the Vassa season, instead of waiting the full year of
novitiate.</p>

<p>By the first of August, with the Vassa half gone,
Oman began to perceive that he was happy:—happy
as he had never believed happiness itself could be. It
seemed to him that he lacked no earthly joy. Hushka,
his Saint, the man he looked up to as the perfect model
of virtue and unselfishness, was one of his four masters;
and Oman was much with him. Apart from this
companionship, he found that he desired nothing.
Solitude was not now loneliness. But though, with
the ineradicable instinct of the Brahman born, he kept
himself aloof from his fellow-novices, they seemed
never to resent this, but rather looked up to him as one
of higher caste than they, and one that had, consequently,
a right to exclusiveness. Moreover, through
the whole Vihara, even by Sugata himself, Oman was
spoken of as a scholar of high promise, such a one as
their decadent community now rarely saw. Treated with
respect on every hand, the memory of his old, marked
days growing dim within him, it seemed to Oman that
his cup of happiness was full. He was mastering the
primal, the greatest difficulties of a religion which, as it
opened, became more and more beautiful to him. In
certain ecstatic hours he saw himself attaining to the
highest state, Arahatship, where pale Nirvana gleamed
like a silver armor of repose around the passionate soul.
His nature was already under subjection; and he no
longer doubted that it was wholly conquerable. The way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
was stretching out before him straight and smooth, the
last boulder lifted away, when, suddenly, out of the clear
sky, came a thunder-bolt that laid waste the fair country
of his life, and left him standing alone, terrified, a
yawning chasm at his feet, the wilderness on either hand.</p>

<p>It happened very simply, and without any sort of
preparation. He sat one afternoon in the library,
among a throng of monks and novices, before him one
of the Vinaya texts, the Mahavagga, a manuscript of
law rigidly adhered to by Buddhist and even by Jainist
communities. There, in the list of those creatures
unfit to receive ordination, and commanded to be
driven from the Samgha if, unknowing, they had been
already ordained, he came upon the sixty-eighth section,
wherein all such as he were declared unfit for holiness,
ineligible for Buddhism, and therefore outlawed, absolutely,
from the blessed life.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>He read the passage once, and then again, slowly.
After that he leaned a little farther over his book, no
longer seeing the writing, hoping only that none
observed him. Stupidly he sat there, for an hour or
more, neither reading nor thinking, only conning over
and over again the two simple verses that had undone
him. And when he had been quiet for a very long time,
an idea came, and he whispered it over, lingeringly,
wistfully, to himself: “I shall not confess. I shall not
confess; and so—they can never know.”</p>

<small>THE WHEEL OF THE LAW</small></h3>
</div>


<p>Four weeks passed, and Oman realized, dully, that
September had come. For him, Time had lost the
power of flight. He took little note now of the incidents
in the life around him. He was in the grip of
his conscience, wholly absorbed in the pangs of a new
suffering. The consciousness that he was an outcast
never left him for a single moment. The All-knowing,
the master, the Buddha, had declared him ineligible
for the serene life, had tacitly denoted him a creature
unfit to attain to any degree of peace. This, after the
first shock of discovery, was his chief thought. Instinctively,
also, he clung to another: the passionate
decision that he should stand alone in his knowledge.
The broad inconsistency between these two points
formed the land of his misery. He dared not reflect on
the workings of the Dharma. He was forbidden, by
every tenet of religion, to use his higher reason in the
criticism of religion. But he knew that he was, by
decision of the law, unfit for the Samgha; and that in
the Samgha he intended, bitterly, to stay.</p>

<p>For long periods his brain went numb with the pressure
of thought refused. Gradually his behavior took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
on an aspect of guilt; and he slunk among his fellows
like one who had committed far worse than a Dukata
offence. He fell off, wofully, in his work, in his comprehension
of the Dharma. He went through his meditations
dull-eyed, palpably unthinking; and the masters
of the novices began to comment on his behavior.
Finally, he got into the habit of torturing himself, daily,
after the last meditation was over, by waiting till every
one had left the hall, and then getting out the manuscript
of the Mahavagga and reading his death-sentence
over again, to make sure of every keenest pang that
lay in it, every drop of poison hidden in its innocent
characters. And after he had seen it, and found that it
was real, that he had not been under the influence of some
baleful misapprehension, he would steal silently to his
cell, and wear the night away in woman’s tears or fierce
rages of rebellion that left him, at dawn, a bundle of
trembling nerves.</p>

<p>The load that he carried became nearly unendurable.
It was lightened by only one thing: when, occasionally
dragging his mind from himself, he looked around him
at his high superiors, the doubly ordained. These, in
their dignity, their approachment to Arahatship, gave
cause for highest wonder at and admiration of their
freedom from all worldly concern. He envied, indeed,
the lowest of the novices. But it seemed to him that,
if he could only receive the Upasampada ordination, he
might, in some way, cheat both himself and his god
into believing in his fitness for the honors of the holy
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>Poor Oman! It had been infinitely easier for him
had he known to how little serenity those envied men
had actually attained! In the strangeness and isolation
of his lot, it was not given him to understand that
there is never a creature that must not bear its burden
and suffer under it, believing it a little heavier, a little
less adaptable, than that of any one else.</p>

<p>The poor novice thought that Upasampada opened
the door upon a life in which a tranquil and scholarly
mounting to perfection, untroubled by a single jarring
incident from the outer world, was a natural sequence.
Those high beings, advancing with rapid paces toward
Nirvâna—surely their hearts and minds knew nothing
of the battles, the uprisings of self, the human desires
and yearnings that he was forever struggling against!
Perhaps, indeed, the monks of the Samgha knew no
such troubles as these. Their difficulties were usually
of a more ignoble kind. As in the monasteries of
another faith, in the far west, the Buddhist Viharas,
even during their pathetic decadence, were too often
seething hot-beds of rivalry and inward strife, thinly
whitewashed with an outer coat of obedience to precept
and renunciation of the fivefold clinging to the
world. In the Vihara, a man desirous of attaining to
Nirvâna had not only his own weakness to conquer, his
own nature to strengthen; but he had before him the
long battle of rivalry with those who, for every step he
advanced, strove to make him take two backward. The
result was, that the Samgha became a place of inner
plots and counter-plots, intrigues worthy of a royal court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
stealthy meetings and conversings of one faction or
another, where obstacles innumerable were devised for
any man who desired to mount to a higher and holier
estate.</p>

<p>Of all the men in the Vihara of Truth, probably no
one had received more of the miserable stabs of envy
and jealousy than had Hushka, the honey-throated.
Greatly beloved—by more than Oman—he was also
passionately hated. It was now twenty years since
his Upasampada ordination; and in all that time he
had known scarcely an hour when he was not enduring
the malicious jealousy of a rival. For a long
time now his opposing faction had been led by Mahapra,
a man who had passed his Upasampada a year
earlier than Hushka, and who had caused him more
and bitterer disappointments and humiliations than any
dozen of his other enemies. And there were those of
his friends who whispered that, had Mahapra been out
of the way, it had not been Sugata who stood now
an Arahat, at the head of the Samgha. Never came
there a Pavarana, scarcely even an Uposatha day, that
Hushka was not made to taste the venom of his enemy;
and there was surely no heart-sickness that he had not
endured. He had suffered as few of his companions
could suffer; for his nature was delicately organized,
and he was sensible to the most refined stings of
misery. With all this, Mahapra himself rarely caught a
glimpse of the wounds he inflicted; for Hushka had the
power of concealment, and the wisdom never to burden
any one with a recital of his own unhappiness. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
thus that, to an outsider, his life could scarcely seem
other than beautiful.</p>

<p>During the last weeks of the Vassa season the constant,
hidden strife that went on in the Samgha centred
itself, curiously enough, around the figure of Oman. In
the early months Hushka, through Oman, had enjoyed
a triumph, for having brought from the pilgrimage a
novice, of Brahman caste, and, moreover, a pupil of such
high intelligence and one so devoted to the Dharma.
The Sugata himself had complimented Hushka on his
pupil’s progress; and at this point Mahapra’s bitterest
ire and fear were roused. Too soon Oman began
to give opening enough for criticism and belittlement.
His laxity in effort and the falling off in his work and
behavior became grossly apparent during the latter
half of August, while whispers and comments from
the adverse faction penetrated even to the Chaitya
hall. From day to day Oman, absorbed in his own
misery, pursued his course unconscious of notice. And
day by day Hushka’s eyes followed him, in doubt and
dread.</p>

<p>Long Hushka forbore to speak; though through the
demeanor of his pupil he suffered as he would scarcely
have believed it possible that he still could suffer. The
Bhikkhu had lately been allowing himself to believe
that the thankless labor of years was about to find its
reward. And now as, little by little, that belief was
broken down, it seemed to carry with it his very vitality,
till he had lost courage to engage with Mahapra any
more in the slightest controversy over the commentators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
or the higher criticism of the holy books. Indeed,
the honey-throated was aging, visibly; and this Oman
woke at last to see.</p>

<p>On the 3d of September the last meditation of
the novices ended rather earlier than usual, at about
seven o’clock. Hushka, who was master of the day,
came in to dismiss them. He stood leaning against a
pillar, near the door, wearily watching them file by,
till the last had gone. Then Hushka turned to glance
over the room, and beheld Oman still standing at
its far end, his face gleaming pale in the waning light.
Hushka gazed at him for a moment or two, and then
moved slowly toward his pupil. Oman stood perfectly
still, trembling a little, till the other halted within a
foot of him. The two looked at each other till the
novice dropped his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oman,” said Hushka, after a heavy pause; “Oman,”
and he paused again, while the guilt-laden one grew
cold, “art thou ill?”</p>

<p>For one, swift instant Oman looked at his master.
“No, reverend sir, I am not ill,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Oman! Oman! Repentest thou of thy faith?”</p>

<p>Oman gave a quick cry. “No!” he answered.</p>

<p>“Yet something troubles thee. Canst thou not
confide in me? Shall not I, thy master, give thee
help? Tell me, Oman, tell me what it is that lies in
thy heart. Do not fear. I have suffered too long, too
well, not to know compassion.”</p>

<p>Oman’s head drooped low. He clasped his two
hands tightly over his breast, and then suddenly threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
them out as if in supplication. Hushka, not understanding
that Oman would have warded him off, took
the hands gently in his own. The warm, living clasp
suddenly broke through Oman’s carefully built barrier
of concealment. He sank to his knees upon the stone
pavement, and his brain burned with the fire of his
knowledge. He was losing his self-control. As tears
fell from his eyes, his thoughts also flowed, till he was
overwhelmed in the torrent of his wretchedness, and
crouched, rent with emotion, at the feet of the troubled
man who supported him.</p>

<p>The dusk deepened. Through the long, carven hall,
eerie shadows fell, and the orange light of the west
melted to purple and then to black, till the two were
alone in darkness. Hushka now knelt by Oman’s side,
and soothed the youth with fragmentary words, till he
was quieter in his grief. There followed silence,
pregnant and foreboding. Hushka would not break it.
Heavy-hearted, dreading unknown things, he bowed
his head, waiting. And gradually it was borne in
upon Oman that there was no longer any way of concealment.
He must give utterance to the truth: his
tragedy. How he began, how he told it, he could not
afterwards remember. At first the words choked him,
then they came faster, finally in fury, till the pent-up
emotions of years were finding expression beside that
of the remorse of yesterday. Hushka remained at his
side, silent, stunned, at first, by the feeling displayed
by this youth, this child to life. It was the first thing
that impressed him:—the silent suffering that Oman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
must have known. Hushka could understand him
there so entirely! He knew each smallest phase, each
bitter turn of the wheel of solitary misery! In his
heart, as yet, was only pity.</p>

<p>Oman came at last to the end of his strength and
his confession. Crouching there, numb, blind with
tears, swollen-lipped, breathing thickly and in gasps,
he found himself, like one groping in a fog, uttering
vague questions—doubts—hopes.</p>

<p>“But it is true? Those words—are they the law,
then? Must Oman follow them? Must I be thrust
forth? Master!—Help me!—Master!” And Hushka
felt the wretched creature clasping his knees in the
darkness.</p>

<p>Then silence fell. Only Oman’s breath could be
heard, rushing in and out, like that of a dying dog.
At this sound, Hushka felt a sudden revulsion, a sudden
despairing anger with him. Was Oman to be
pitied:—Oman, who had wrecked his, Hushka’s life,
as well as his own? The monk rose from his knees,
walked across the hall, and stood at one of the unscreened
openings, staring out into the starlit night.
Here, silently, he struggled with himself:—struggled
for justice toward Oman, justice toward the Samgha,
toward himself. Oman had not moved from the place
where he was at first. Only now he lay prone on the
floor, and his breathing was quiet. He was waiting,
without any feeling, without any emotion, for his
sentence.</p>

<p>The suspense continued for a long time. Hushka’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
heart was full, and his brain reeling. Now he addressed
himself passionately to Gautama, now he turned to his
own judgment. Prayer and reasoning, however, led
him alike to one conclusion—a conclusion pitiless to
himself, pitiless to Oman. Nay, the cruel result was
inevitable. Oman had dared formulate nothing to
himself; but Hushka was obliged to face the situation.</p>

<p>After a long time, then, the monk went back to his
pupil, sat down beside him, laid a trembling hand on
the prostrate shoulder, and began to speak, softly, as a
mother might:</p>

<p>“Thou knowest, Oman, that the word of the Mahavagga
is our law. If the Samgha knew this thing that
thou hast told me, thou wouldst suffer public exposition
and expulsion. I, knowing, dare not let thee remain
here. Thou must escape to-night, quietly; and I will
be here to—to accept the consequences of thy going.
I can do no more for thee. But the blessed Buddha,
the Sakya—”</p>

<p>He broke off, suddenly, for Oman, raising himself
halfway from the floor, had begun to laugh. Hushka
shuddered as he listened. It was so high, so harsh, so
quavering, that it seemed as if it must go on forever.
But suddenly it broke, and melted into a long, heart-broken
wail. Oman was going to pieces; and Hushka
sanely set to work to stop it. How it was accomplished
he scarcely knew. Under sharp command and
gentlest soothing Oman was presently quiet again, save
for the trembling of his body, and the little, broken
moans that involuntarily escaped him. Now that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
had pulled himself together, Hushka left him for a
quarter of an hour, and then reappeared, carrying over
one arm an old and much-worn garment that was not
yellow. In the other hand he had a small millet loaf.</p>

<p>Oman was dimly aware of being stripped of his robes,
of having the other garments put upon him. Then
he received into his hand the food. After that he
followed his preceptor quietly out into the empty
veranda. Behind them the monastery was still. Over
the great world beyond, the golden moon was slowly
rising. In its light, Oman turned a dumb face to the
man he had so worshipped. He saw that Hushka was
suffering—suffering as perhaps high Sakyamuni had
not suffered. Neither one of them, however, could
speak. Hushka, with an air of benediction, pressed
his fingers, once, to the cold brow of the outcast. Then,—he
was gone. Oman was alone on the brink of
the world, irrevocably and forever shut out from the
protecting walls behind him. Outcast of men, he
stood, facing life. And, since he had already drunk
the dregs of feeling, mercifully his heart was numb.
After a little he moved off, unsteadily, into the faint-starred
blackness of the ravine: halted, went on again
to the edge of moonlight, and then paused once more,
struck by some new thought, expectant, his head uplifted.
Out of the night came the sound of whirring
wings. He opened wide his arms, and into them flew
a small, gray bird that nestled to his breast as if it had
been at home. Holding the mysterious creature close,
Oman proceeded, staggering, through the night, down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
and down the ravine, till all the Viharas were passed,
and a few lights, twinkling in the distance, showed him
the town of Bágh. Then, utterly exhausted in body
and mind, he crawled, on his hands and knees, under a
spreading bush, and, with the bird still warm in his
bosom, gave himself up to merciful sleep.</p>

<small>THE OUTCAST</small></h3>
</div>


<p>Blank hours passed. The glimmer of false dawn
came and went again. At last the day, inevitable,
rose, like an opal, out of the East. The silent world
was overspread with clear light; and, in its first
moments, the bird, which till now had lain motionless
on Oman’s breast, fluttered up, hovered for a second
over the quiet form, and then took flight, winging
away into the invisible. Oman was still sleeping: a
heavy, transitional sleep.</p>

<p>Day swept up the sky, and the blazoning sun whirled
from the heart of the hills. Now, at last, Oman opened
his eyes, sat up, looked around—stared, indeed,
and all at once remembered fully. For the moment
memory unnerved him. Then the strain proved again
too great; and, with a renewed sense of dulness, he
rose. The bird was gone. He seemed to have known
that before. He wished now to discover his whereabouts.
In the darkness he had reached the end of the
ravine, and was at the edge of a long, barren slope, to
the west of Bágh. The houses of the town began not
far away. He could see people moving about there;
and the sight of them reminded him that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
hungry. He felt faint, a little weak, and shaken, with
the after effects of last night’s tumult. He determined
not to enter Bágh. With an undefined weight of grief
and ruin upon him, he began to toil upward along the
slope, turning his face to the north, where the high hills
rose. And, as he went, he ate the millet-loaf that
Hushka had put into his hand.</p>

<p>It was a fair morning, hot, cloudless, blazing. Oman
wilted in the heat, but his steps went on, mechanically.
He had already determined in his mind to reach the
hills that day. As he went, he found his thoughts
groping vaguely in once-accustomed ways: loneliness—fear
of people—hatred of those that shunned
him—hunger—physical discomfort—all the old details
of that solitude that he knew so well. And still his
feet did not falter. It was his masculine nature that
upheld him now; but, adding to his dread, he felt the
feminine, knocking—knocking at his heart, at his
brain; and he fought desperately against admittance,
knowing that, when it came, his suffering would be
trebly increased.</p>

<p>His old training with Hushka stood him in good
stead to-day. He made progress. By noon, seven
miles stretched between him and Bágh, and he was
now among the foothills of the great Vindhyas, which,
so far as he knew, stretched eastward before him into
infinity. In this thought there was something like
comfort. Those dark-wooded wilds meant refuge from
men and the haunts of men. There should be no day
in his life to come when he would not be able to plunge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
into some deep ravine, or mount some thickly jungled
steep, knowing, in his heart, that whither he went no
curious, human eyes could rest on him, no living creature
follow. He felt just now that never again, while
he was doomed to remain on earth, would he suffer a
glance from human eyes.</p>

<p>At noon, after a few moments’ rest, Oman plunged
into the woods and began to move upward to the
heights. The underbrush was not too thick to prevent
progress; and the trunks of young trees afforded grasping-places
for his hands. In this sort of country snakes
were supposed to abound; but he moved on without
any fear of them. No wild thing would molest him.
Only man he feared.</p>

<p>After a while he found refreshment. In the dense
undergrowth were bushes and trees bearing fruits; and
many of these were at their ripening season. Mangoes
and custard apples there were in plenty, and
tamarinds and a few bananas. He was also presented
with a cocoanut, delivered by an interested monkey,
who first flung it at him, and then came hurrying to
the ground to see what had happened. The incident
proved unfortunate, however. The suggestion of fellowship
about the little, bright-eyed thing, unnerved
Oman for the space of a second. In that second he
was undone. The door opened to the woman. Tears
flooded his eyes, and, throwing himself upon the
ground, he yielded to an outburst of the wildest
grief. The monkey, who had seated himself near
at hand, scratching his black head and chattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
volubly to the stranger, now looked on sorrowfully,
and shed a few tears himself:—wherefore, who can
say? After a time, when Oman had recovered again,
the grotesque little creature broke the cocoanut against
the tree trunk, and solemnly offered half of it to his
new friend. There in the jungle they ate together;
and presently, when the monkey had run off to rejoin
his tribe, Oman rose and moved on, comforted and
fortified.</p>

<p>The incident had turned his thoughts away from
himself; and the afternoon passed rapidly. At nightfall
he halted once more, near the summit of a hill, ate
again of the fruits of Mother Earth, and lay down in
the solemn stillness, not to sleep very readily this time.
Physically, he was very tired. Mentally, he was waking.
He must now—alas!—begin to weigh his loss, and
face the future. His thoughts travelled back through
the few intervening months to the spring, when he had
wandered southward with Hushka. Then he reviewed
the early part of the Vassa, and began to see how his
life had broadened before him. There had taken
place his first struggles against himself; and there
could be marked his first victories. He recalled to
mind passages of the Dharma, which he had loved
to think were made for him alone. And, with this
memory, the bitterness became intolerable. He lifted
his arms toward the stars and wailed his woe. And
passively the stars shone on, nor heeded him. The
parts of nature, so imperturbable, so enduring, so
changeless,—were they satisfied? Had they received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
enough of God? Oh, surely, yes! On all save him had
the Creator showered blessings, to all given gifts and
mercies. He, only, was marked out for constant woe,
constant disappointment, constant misery. Having
thus grieved through long hours, the outcast finally
closed his eyes upon his first day of probation, and
once more slept.</p>

<p>On the morrow he found himself able to make less
progress. His nature, lately accustomed to over-nourishment,
demanded something more substantial than
fruit and nuts. He began to realize that, until he
became inured to this life, he must occasionally have a
little grain, or meat. Also, the utter loneliness of the
vast jungle through which he travelled, began to appall
him. He had so lately known the constant companionship
of many men, that there hung over him a sense
of direst oppression, in this uninhabited wilderness.
His recently engendered dread and hatred of humankind
was already giving way to an unconquerable longing
for the sight of a human face.</p>

<p>On the third morning he woke almost to desperation.
Should nothing happen to him to-day, he felt that he
must break under the strain of thought:—that empty,
beating thought—of nothing. Meantime, there crept
upon him the insidious desire to try again, only once
again, if men would not accept him; if, knowing nothing
of him, his mark must be apparent to a point of instinctive
aversion. And, at the same time with this, he
was coming to something that he had not had to endure
before. He was beginning to hate himself for what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
was. His restless longing to be respected among men
turned him away from that rebellion against them
which had long possessed him; and, in the revulsion,
he went to the other extreme: hating himself because
he could not be as others.</p>

<p>The whole afternoon of the third day he spent in
toiling up a great hill, the summit of which was reached
at sunset; and from this height he gained recompense
for the long travail. Around him—to the south—to
the east—to the west, rolled great hills, verdure-clad.
No sign of plain or level land was visible. On three
sides of him the hills stretched away, a little lower
than that on which he stood. But in front, to the
north, rose a series of gigantic, rocky heights, which
towered infinitely upward, bringing him a realizing
sense of his own pygmy unimportance. And now his
eyes, travelling downward, perceived the deep ravine
that separated him from the first of the high mountains;
and, looking, his heart leaped within his breast.
For there, in that gulf, were houses:—mud huts,
wooden ones—two, three, a score; and beside them
ran a swift mountain stream, the murmur of which rose
up to him through the stillness.</p>

<p>“I will go down! I will go down to them, for
they are built of men!” he said to himself, eagerly,
like a child. And forthwith he began his descent,
walking with a new buoyance. As he proceeded, his
way grew difficult. The houses, far below, were hidden
from his view in the thickness of the undergrowth.
The light was melting away; for the sun lay on the edge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
of the horizon, behind the hills. Still he pressed on, a
tempered joy in his heart that was not to be stilled by
reason.</p>

<p>Though he hurried, darkness was on him before he
reached the level; and then, indeed, it seemed as if
he must resign himself to another night of solitude.
Nevertheless he fought, still refusing to abandon his
hope. And suddenly, from a more open space on the
slope, he looked down and saw, but a little way below,
half a dozen shining lights—flames of sacrificial fires.
And after that no falls, no bruises, no difficulties of
the precipitous way, could keep him back. An hour
after sunset he stood at the edge of the clearing where
the village was.</p>

<p>The first hut was near at hand: a square one, tiny,
tumble-down, even squalid. Yet it was roofed over with
wood, and within the open doorway firelight shone.
There must be human creatures there; and there
Oman was determined to enter. He approached, almost
reverently, and halted before the door. Within, was
only one person—a woman, or girl, of perhaps sixteen.
Her dress proclaimed her widowhood, and her
caste was too easily recognizable. Oman, however,
accustomed to such matters, thought of nothing but
that she was a woman—kneading barley-cakes before
her fire; and, as he watched her, his heart warmed
with humanness, and he smiled. After a moment she,
lifting her head, perceived him, dimly outlined near
the doorway. At once she rose, though without any
welcome in her eyes, and advanced, with respectful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
salute, saying, in a voice that was pleasantly modulated:</p>

<p>“Enter, sir, enter. I have entertainment for him
that desires it.”</p>

<p>Oman shook his head. “I come from out of the hills.
Nor have I any money,” he added, suddenly aware of
his destitution.</p>

<p>But the girl only saluted him again: “The reverend
One is a Brahmana.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Enter, then, in the name of the
gods.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Wandering fakirs of any religion were called “Brahmanas,” a
word to be distinguished from “Brahmans.”</p>

</div>

<p>Once more, though slowly and with deep reluctance,
Oman shook his head. “I am neither Bhikkhu nor
Brahmana,” he answered. “I am—an outcast.”</p>

<p>For a moment the woman turned away her head,
and Oman’s heart sank. But, all of a sudden, she
ran to him, taking him by the hand, and looking at
him so that he perceived the gentleness of her face and
eyes. “Enter,” she whispered. “I am lonely. I will
share my cakes with you. And there is milk.—But
my husband’s brother must not know this thing. He
is of the weaver caste; and he is very proud.”</p>

<p>Chattering in a subdued voice, she led him in, and
placed him before the crackling fire, the smoke of
which escaped through a hole in the roof. The cakes
which she had just kneaded and shaped lay on a board
before the fire, baking questionably. Now she ran to
a cupboard in the corner and took therefrom a large
jar of meal, a little of which she put into an earthen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
pot, near at hand. Water, from another jar, was
poured over the grain; and then she set the dish in the
fire, where the simple porridge was soon steaming
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Oman sat silent on the floor, looking on with rising
emotions. It was such an unspeakable luxury to
watch her, low-caste and poverty-stricken as she was,
moving about in the one-roomed hut which was none
too tidy in its simple arrangements, that he could not
be ashamed of his beggary. The meal was soon ready;
but, before he ate, the wanderer, suddenly realizing
what his appearance must be, took occasion to make
use of some of the contents of the water-jar for his face
and hands. The girl brought him a piece of cloth on
which he dried himself; and, when he turned to the fire
again, she cried out:</p>

<p>“Why! Thou art beautiful! And—ah! You
are not an outcast!” And, leaning over, she laid her
hand on the Brahman cord still fastened over his left
shoulder.</p>

<p>Oman looked at it—and flushed. He had a momentary
impulse to tear the thong away. But the
impulse passed, and it was not done. His father had
not removed it. Why should he? So, without answering
the girl’s exclamatory question, he turned
again to the fire, and she, with great forbearance, refrained
from pursuing the subject.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant meal,—the pleasantest, perhaps,
that Oman had ever known. The girl, who gave her
name as Poussa, chattered to him unrestrainedly:—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
her life; of her brother-in-law, who took most of her
wages, and beat her when these were too little; of the
doings of the little village; and a thousand details of
the people therein, that brought new warmth to Oman’s
heart. In return he told her something of himself:—that
he had been a weaver, but had gone to join the
Bhikkhus, with whom he had now tired of living.
She seemed satisfied with what he said, and they
talked, comfortably, while she cleared away the remains
of their meal, and then, returning, seated herself
in front of him, and took his two hands and kissed
them.</p>

<p>“See how my heart inclines to my lord. I love
him,” she said, simply.</p>

<p>Oman started to his feet, shaking her from him
violently. Then he strode to the doorway, and stood
there, staring into the night, till Poussa, frightened,
crept to him again, and, kneeling at his feet, timidly
sought his pardon.</p>

<p>“Nay, Poussa, nay, there is no fault. But I must
not remain with thee, for I am not of thy kind—not
like other men.”</p>

<p>“Lord, I know it well. Thou art far above me; yet
I beseech thee to remain, and I will trouble thee no
more. Ah, let my lord incline himself to my forgiveness!”
And so prettily did she entreat, and so weak
was he with the yearning for sympathy, that, in the
end, he did as she asked, and returned into the hut,
where they fell to talking again.</p>

<p>Before he slept that night, however, Oman learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
something of the personal life of his pathetic little
hostess. They were still before the fire, but their talk
had grown fitful and full of pauses, when, out of the
blackness beyond the open door appeared a man, lean,
ill shapen, but well clothed. His face was not good
to look upon, and his expression made it worse. In
the doorway he halted, apparently not intending to
come in, after he had seen Oman. Nor did he speak;
but stood still for a moment, looking hard at Poussa.
Words from him were unnecessary. Oman and the
girl saw him at the same moment, and she, her face
instantly losing its tranquil look, sprang to her feet,
and, running to the door, saluted the newcomer with
profoundest respect. The man snarled some words
at her, the purport of which Oman caught. They
related to money—apparently a demand to see what
she had earned during the day. Poussa fell upon her
knees, pleading, in a low tone, that her guardian would
refrain from altercation in Oman’s presence. The
man seemed to accede to her request, and, after a few
words more, the lowered tone of which did not lessen
their ugliness, strode off again into the darkness.</p>

<p>Oman, relieved at the departure, looked up, prepared
to find Poussa smiling again. He was disappointed.
The girl finally rose from her knees and came back
again. But her head was bent, and her whole attitude
one of deep dejection. Indeed, by the glow of the low
fire, Oman perceived that slow tears were rolling from
her eyes, and that her hands were clasped as if in
pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“Why do you weep? He is gone. You are safe,”
he began, half timidly.</p>

<p>Poussa looked up at him with eyes full of misery.
“Early to-morrow he will come again. And then—I
shall be beaten. Oh, I shall be beaten!”</p>

<p>“But why—why will he beat you?” he demanded,
in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Because—no, it is nothing.” She would not speak.</p>

<p>Oman took her by the shoulders. “Why will he
beat you?” he asked, stupidly.</p>

<p>“He is my brother-in-law,” she responded, as if that
were quite sufficient to explain any cruelty.</p>

<p>“He desired money,” muttered Oman to himself.
“Ah—ah—I see! <i>I</i> have no money for you! <i>I!</i>”</p>

<p>Poussa quivered under his touch, and her answer
was only a faint moan.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! It is unendurable! Do you hear? It
is unendurable! Let me go after him! I will tell
him.”</p>

<p>“No.” The word was firm. “No. He would only
beat you. He is master in this village. I am used
to it. See, I will not weep—I weep no more. Come,
we will sleep now. Let us sleep.”</p>

<p>But Oman was not satisfied. He had too much of
the woman in him to be indifferent to the prospect of a
woman’s suffering. Because of charity to him, a woman
was to be beaten! The thought was too much. In his
agitation, he began to pace up and down the little room,
thinking—suffering—once again cursing his fate. Suddenly
something caught his attention. In the dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
corner of the room, beside the unshuttered window, was
a rough hand-loom, half filled with a piece of badly
woven cloth. Before this Oman paused, considering.</p>

<p>“Thou sayest thy husband’s brother is a weaver?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. He is a weaver. He caused this loom to be
built in my house, that I might occupy my idle hours
in working at it. But I cannot weave evenly enough
for him to sell the cloth I make. Therefore only my
own garments can be fashioned from what I do,” she
explained, in a dreary tone.</p>

<p>Oman, however, had suddenly recovered himself.
“It is well, Poussa. I shall repay thy brother for thy
charity. Come, I beseech thee, do not weep.” He
laid a hand upon her shoulder, smiled into her eyes,
and presently, in spite of herself, she was comforted;
and, through Oman’s gentle words, forgot her trouble.
In a little time they went to rest, Poussa lying upon
her accustomed bed, Oman on the floor near the door.
And both of them being weary with the day, they
shortly slept.</p>

<p>In the first gray of morning, however, Oman was
astir. While the light in the hut was still too faint
for him to see clearly, he took the empty water-jar
from its place, ran down through the still, shadowy
hamlet to the edge of the mountain stream, into which
he first plunged himself, coming out shivering and
gasping, but refreshed; and then, after drying himself
in the air, he replaced his tattered garments, filled
his jar with water, and returned to Poussa’s hut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
where a bright daylight now threw the meagre furniture
into bold relief. Poussa herself still lay upon the
pallet, sleeping like a child. And Oman, after looking
at her for a moment with a sudden tenderness in his
heart, sat himself down at the loom, and, with a thrill
of independence and pleasure, set to work, first remedying
and straightening the knotted and uneven warp
already stretched; and then, seeing that there was
plenty of yarn left for the weft, began to throw it on.</p>

<p>A full hour later Poussa woke to the “hock-hock-hock”
of the loom, before which sat her guest of the
previous evening. The shuttle was flying fast over
the straight and even threads, and, under Oman’s fingers,
which had lost none of their skill of five months
before, the finished cloth was slowly gathering in the
frame: as fine a bit of work as her brother himself
could have put forth. After a moment’s staring, to
wake herself from a supposed dream, Poussa, with a
little cry, ran to the loom and gazed into Oman’s face.</p>

<p>“Thou! Thou an outcast! Thou’rt even Krishna
himself!” she cried, throwing herself on her knees
before him, while he ceased his work and bent over
her, smiling and protesting.</p>

<p>“In this way I pay my debt to thee. Tell me!
When I have worked all day, and have produced a
piece of cloth that will bring twenty copper pieces,
will he then forbear to beat thee?” he asked.</p>

<p>Poussa stooped over the loom, examining the work
at first anxiously, then with delight. “Yes—ah
yes! It is more than enough. Thou hast saved me!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
and, throwing herself on the floor, she touched Oman’s
feet with her brow. Then, when he had raised her
up, she began, joyously, the more useful task of preparing
breakfast.</p>

<p>Oman was true to his word. All the morning,
barring the half hour in which he and Poussa broke
their fast, he toiled at the loom, till Poussa’s guardian
came for the expected money. The interview with him
Oman undertook, making as much explanation as he
saw fit, and allowing Salivan to examine his handiwork
critically. Salivan was satisfied. His own vanity
could not deny that the work was good. Though
the man’s words were few and not overgracious, Poussa’s
face, after his departure, all radiant as it was with relief
and pride, doubled Oman’s reward, and he toiled
from pure pleasure to the last moment of the light.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon Poussa, whose work began
late in the day, went to the forest to gather firewood;
and Oman, left alone at the loom, began to meditate.
His first musings were vague: instinctive impressions
rather than definite ideas; but he was too much master
of this art of thought to leave them, as most Hindoos
would, in embryo. As his shuttle flew in and
out of the warp on the loom, so were his thoughts
busy weaving a new pattern on his fabric of life. But,
in his imagination, there grew two distinct possibilities,
one of which must soon be made a fact, the other discarded.
One was the natural existence of a man
among his fellows—himself, settling quietly down
in this world-sheltered spot, to weave away his life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
in tranquil monotony. The other presented to him
a strange aspect, beginning in hardship, in loneliness,
in unceasing trial and probation, and ending in—he
knew not what. And perhaps just in this uncertainty
lay the fascination that, from the beginning,
made the harder course seem so much more attractive
than the other. After all, he was not as other men;
and, by the arrangement of inscrutable providence,
life could never look to him as it looked to those who
had been given individual lives and individual chances.</p>

<p>For many hours Oman’s fancy played thus with
destiny; and all the while, in his inmost heart, he
knew that, when the choice came, he should not hesitate.
He knew that Fate enwrapped him, grim, unconquerable.
And he knew that he should run the
course prescribed by her, though all the temptations
of humankind were placed in his way. For so much
of the scheme of his life disclosed itself to him.</p>

<p>At dusk, Poussa returned, staggering under a
weight of boughs. Oman met her at the door, and
took half of her load from her, as a woman might, she
standing by the while, wondering what manner of
man it was that would help her at such a task. When
the Agnihotra was burning the two sat down, cross-legged,
beside the fire; and she, assuming for a moment,
unconsciously, a rôle of Fate, began to try him,
tempting:</p>

<p>“O High-born, listen! It has been spread about
through the village that thou, a master weaver, art
come among us. Soon my brother-in-law will ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
you to take up your abode with him, that you may
jointly ply the trade. My master, say not again that
thou art outcast of men. Come thou and dwell near
me, and let me serve thee, who will then have the
happiness of thy nearness. As Krishna pities women
and protects them, so do thou!”</p>

<p>It was thus that she brought up a new battle in
Oman’s soul. Two forces struggled again within
him: one, man’s natural need; the other—what?
The summoning of the higher law? The half-conscious
necessity for the fulfilment of his mission?
Something of these. Something that would not yield
the battle. Something that had taken possession of
Oman’s mind, and would not lessen its hold, but
forced from him words that were scarcely his own.
Yet even secretly rebelling, he recognized the power
that had hitherto held him. He perceived that it was
the first choice that had been given him:—his first
glimpse of the two roads that stretch before every
living thing. And, in gratitude for this new trust,
he yielded to the power, and spoke as Prophets speak:</p>

<p>“Nay, Poussa. I may not dwell among you. My
way lies upward and on. My destiny cannot be the
destiny of men; for I travel the road of those that
have sinned. ‘A burning forest shuts my roadside
in.’ One more night I shall remain with you, and
then I set out again—up—to the heights above,
there to finish my soul’s travail. Yet I shall see thee
again; for, in my weakness, I must return to thee for
help. Do not grieve. For what I do has been already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
decreed, and is now turning from the wheel of present
time. Let us speak of it no more.”</p>

<p>Poussa obeyed him. Nor was he to be moved by
the suave arguments of Salivan, who returned, that
evening, to examine his work, and to lay the proposition
of partnership before him. Yet, in the silent
watches of the night, doubts came, and he wondered
at himself for his choice. The morning scarcely
brought comfort; and how it was that he fulfilled
his word, it would be hard to say. But it is true
that, while the day was young, he withdrew himself
from Poussa’s clasp and set out, alone once more,
into the world, up, toward the great mountain that
overhung the village to the north, and was called of
men the “Silver Peak”. Thither went Oman, driven
by destiny, to attain to the heights that held for him,
though he knew it not, on the one hand the scourge
of suffering and blind wandering for the soul; on the
other the crown of victory and life.</p>

<small>THE STRUGGLE ON THE HEIGHT</small></h3>
</div>


<p>In all great mountain ranges there are what might
be called heights of man and heights of nature.
There are always hills that seem to invite the puny
human agility: that hold at their summits resting-places
whence men may obtain their “view” and
begin their descent again, filled with pride at the conquest
of inconsequent difficulties. But there are other
heights that were not made for such: places which,
even should man attain to them, refuse him his vain
reward, bind him about with a spell of bewildered awe,
and, if he safely reach his earth-kennel once more, leave
him with the sense that he has been refused his due.</p>

<p>Heights such as these owe nothing to humanity.
They are the retreating-places of defeated nature. To
man they are not natural. Their high glory is not
for him. Towering into regions above slow-drifting
clouds, where sun and stars and moon lean close on
high, they are in communion with eternity. Nor is their
secret of the ages to be borne away and exploited in
the depths below.</p>

<p>Such a height as this rose up beyond the little hamlet
of the mountain stream. Its peak, a spirelike pinnacle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
not so lofty when compared with Himalayan or even
Alpine heights, rose up from a high, rounded plateau
which itself lay above the tops of the surrounding
hills. On the far side of the mountain the slope
ran gradually down to the basin of a tiny mountain
lake, that lay five hundred feet above the valley level.
But on the south end of this heavenly plateau, rocks
jutted down in a vast, tumbling mass, to a depth of three
thousand feet. Alone in its far summit, sunlit, glorious,
the strange mountain top might have been hailed
king of the whole range. And, indeed, it was one of
the few mountains of the Vindhyas distinctive enough
to possess a name. The valley dwellers called it
the “Silver Peak”; and its name fitted it well. The
eastern slope was densely wooded. The rocks at
the base of the peak on the plateau were filled
with caves; yet animals and reptiles shunned these
easy abodes. Only sure-flying birds, eagles and falcons
and kingfishers and floriken, swept through its forests
and over its height, unawed by the inviolable stillness.
But this stillness, unbroken since the day the
mountain rose from the earth’s seething surface, was
something to be feared. Here man had been defeated
in the moment of his triumph. His blatant voice, lifted
upon this royal height, had shrunk to a faint whisper;
and he had fled his sacrilege in shame.</p>

<p>It was midday on the height. Overhead blazed
a September sun, infinitely brilliant. The plateau,
bathed in gold, lay drowsy in the noontide. Below,
a few shreds of silvery cloud clung about the rocks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
veiling higher mysteries from the lower world. The
loneliness was absolute. Neither eagle nor cormorant
dared the sun at this hour; and it seemed as if
living things had never existed here. Not one world-murmur
sent its vibration through the tranquil atmosphere.
Man and the works of man were forgotten
or undreamed-of. Here was such peace as the flesh-clothed
spirit cannot know: the peace that terrifies,
because it was declared primevally of God.</p>

<p>Up to this height from the depths below came
Oman, mounting slowly, all but overcome with the
long toil of nearly twenty hours. From the torrent,
through cloud fringes, out of forest darkness came
he, upborne by his strange will. Reaching at last the
level, he walked on it till he emerged from the trees
into an open space, on one side of which rose the rocky
wall of the peak, pierced with its little caves. Far to
the east, down the long, slow slope, twenty-five hundred
feet below, the lake lay glittering with golden
ripples. Beyond it hills rolled, on and on, till, in the
far morning-land, they ended in a deep, violet mist.</p>

<p>Here, in the open, Oman paused and looked. As he
stood, gaunt and tall, clad in the floating, tattered raiment
of some long-dead Bhikkhu, in his right hand a
stout staff, in his left a small bag of millet—Poussa’s
gift, the two spirits in him looking out through his
great eyes, there was no suggestion of triumph about
him. He was overcome by the wonderful beauty
of the surrounding scene; but he also betrayed a terrible
fatigue, the fatigue of mind, as well as of body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
The mountain lazily surveyed him as he stood, and
perceived that he carried the key to the gate of solitude.
He was not to be denied admittance. Deserted
of mankind he had come unto Nature, asking shelter
from the world; and Nature, pitying, could not refuse.</p>

<p>Still actuated by the spirit that seemed distinct from
himself, Oman moved slowly toward the rocky ridge,
and entered one of the caves that pierced it. Here
was a place that would shelter him from storms; and
here, should nights prove cold, a fire would always
live. In the cave’s mouth he sat, for a long time,
musing on the possibilities of making an abode in
this strange place. There seemed to be only one vital
lack. There was no sign of water anywhere about.
Should that not exist, he must descend again. This
thought caused his heart fairly to sink. Obeying
a quick impulse, he set out in search of water; and it
was nearly an hour before, fifty feet down the eastern
slope, he found a spring that sent a tiny, falling thread
down in the direction of the lake, till it was lost under
the earth, a long way below.</p>

<p>The last obstacle was gone now. This place was
fitted to be his abode. Here, far from the reach of his
kind, he would dwell, till he had fashioned for himself
a life that should be impervious to the shafts
of wanton injustice and cruelty. Here he must fight
the great battle of his dual nature, the outcome of
which he himself could not foresee.</p>

<p>This much settled, he turned to practical needs.
After a long draught of water, he went back to his cave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
and began the tedious process of building a fire after the
fashion of the woodsman:—twirling a small, pointed
stick, like a drill, into a close-fitting hole made in a piece
of harder wood; feeding the heat with fine dust particles
and crumbled dead leaves, till at last a flame appeared.
It was a matter of an hour or more before his fire was
ready; and by this time Oman was famished with hunger.
He parched some of his millet on a flat stone, ate it with
eagerness, and finished the meal with some mangoes
gathered on the mountain side. Then, his faintness relieved,
though his hunger was not wholly satisfied, he lay
down and slept, waking again just as the sun was setting.</p>

<p>The wonder of the following hour made an impression
on him that was indelible: that bound him about
with a spell which lasted as long as he dwelt upon the
mountain top. Far away in the great west, from the
palpitating flame in which the sun had set, spread a
vast cloud of deepening crimson that slowly broadened,
through the air and over the hills, clothing peak after
peak with rose-gold, its misty glow shimmering over
the whole earth, till every crag, every tree-top, every
eagle’s wing, was transcended with the light. Gradually
the color shifted, changed, sunk to a paler pink,
encompassed with gray and violet shadows that
shrouded the form of Night, who presently set on
high her beacon: the diamond-pointed evening star,
hanging, tremulous, in the deep-tinted west. And
lo! as the swift Indian twilight died, the sister stars
one by one flashed into view, till the sky was crowned
with them, and the day lay dead under a velvet pall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>Slowly Oman turned and walked back into his cave,
his sense of exaltation changing into oppression: a
realization of his infinite littleness before the immensity
of the changeless world. Night after night
such a scene as he had just witnessed was unfolded
here, where no mortal eye was supposed to look on it.
He felt himself an intruder in a holy shrine. His
presence was the sacrilege of an inviolate fane, the retreating-place
of God. And the loneliness, the oppression
of his senses, was like the weight of the whole
mountain on his soul. Still, through it all, was a joy:
the joy of the knowledge of those things that no man
knoweth, the splendor that man cannot parallel.</p>

<p>All that night Oman scarcely slept; and yet the hours
were not long. His mind wandered unrestrained
through space. His thoughts were of a great and solemn
beauty, of which he was scarcely conscious. In
the first glimmer of dawn he left his rocky bed,
and went out again into the open, this time turning
his face to the east. And there was enacted before
him another indescribable drama, which lasted till the
sun was high in the heavens. Then he returned to
eat another meagre meal of parched grain, supplemented
with water. That bare sustenance seemed the
only permissible food in the face of the ascetic splendors
of sky and mountain-top. All through the day
he moved quietly about the plateau, feeling more and
more that it would be impossible now for him to leave
the enchanted place. And the mountain, still watching
how he moved and communed, humbly, within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
himself, sanctioned his presence, and bade him welcome
to her undisciplined heights.</p>

<p>Such was the beginning of his sojourn on the Silver
Peak, which lasted not weeks nor months, but years—how
many years, Oman never knew. The tale of this
life might be compassed in a line, if one dealt only with
events; but the mental phases through which he passed
are scarcely to be transcribed. Life was sustained in
him by the meagrest food. He lived as the Chelahs
live: upon his soul; and was satisfied therewith.
In the beginning, he was forced to return some dozen
times to the hamlet in the valley, where he wove on
Poussa’s loom, to earn grain enough to live on. But,
early in his hermit’s life, he ploughed himself a field
on the plateau, planted millet-seed therein, and, after
that, reaped two scanty crops a year:—enough to live
on. And from the period of his first harvest, he descended
no more into the valley, where Poussa mourned
for him as dead.</p>

<p>To one choosing, or chosen for, the life Oman had
elected, dwelling in utter solitude from year to year,
two courses are open. If the physical in him predominates,
he draws out of the nature around him
all that is animal, savage, or untamed, gradually
loses his powers of thought and articulation, finally,
the very habits of man, becoming a creature wilder
than the wild things themselves. But, if he be of the
spiritual type, a dreamer or religious fanatic, he draws
toward him the soul of Nature; his mind expands as
his body dwindles; and it is said that strange psychical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
powers come to him. With Oman, in the beginning,
it seemed doubtful which he was to become:
beast or angel. Buddhism had not uprooted the
passion and the animal instincts of his dual spirit;
but it had at least opened his eyes to the spiritual life.
For many months—two, or perhaps three years, even—the
battle of the two forces raged within him. And
probably it was the mere fact that he was able for so
long a time to retain spiritual remembrance, that gave
him victory in the end. At first his moods alternated.
For days at a time he would sit wrapped in a state of
impenetrable calm, meditating as Gautama had meditated.
Then, without any warning, the brute in him
would rise, and, driven by it, he would range through
the mountain woods like a demon, climbing, goat-like,
over crags and precipices, and performing feats
of physical strength that were almost superhuman.
Again, suddenly, in one breath, he would break into
a tempest of tears and cries, and, flinging himself
on the ground, wherever he happened to be, would
lie there, shaken with sobs, till sheer exhaustion
brought quiet. Reaction never failed him, however;
and it was always the same. Quietly, like a numb,
dazed creature, he would rise and drag himself back
to the open summit and his cave, and there would sleep,
for an uncalculated period. When he woke he ate;
and, in the torpor that followed, the great calm would
descend on him again.</p>

<p>His tempests were always a source of deep trouble
and dejection to him. That incomprehensible womanishness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
that lived within him he half despised and half
deplored. When she was uppermost, she was pitiable
enough. Her high, wailing voice roused the dreariest
echoes among the surrounding rocks; and one hearing
them might have fancied himself listening to a chorus
of damned souls wandering along the road to Kutashala
Mali. This weaker spirit used, in the beginning, to
be roused by the thunderstorms which, from time to
time, raged across the heights. With the first hissing
fire-streak that crossed the sky, Oman’s frame would
be shaken by a quiver of terror, and he would cower
away into his rude habitation, and, covering his face,
remain moaning and trembling with every crash, every
blaze of lightning, every fresh onslaught of cold rain.
To him it was as if these phenomena brought back some
experience of the dimly veiled past, when, in words that
smote his ears like the near thunder itself, he had heard
pronounced on him a doom, and had thenceforth been
plunged into deepest night.</p>

<p>After the passing of the storm, when the stars came
radiantly forth upon the newly refreshed sky, or the
sun shone through an upstretched, radiant bow, there
would steal upon the stricken creature of the cave a
sense of comfort and consolation almost repaying the
evil hour of fear. At such times, Oman would put
away his sense of wretchedness and shame; and his
heart would open out in praise. What he should
praise, whom, which of the gods his life had known,
he could not tell. None of them all—Siva, Vishnu,
Indra, not the Buddha himself—could satisfy his new,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
groping sense. But the searching, seeking, wondering
after the unknown, the greatly desired, usually led him
back into his state of meditation, where he could claim
himself again a man.</p>

<p>In the end, it was this search that brought him into
the kingdom. Brahman born, a Vedic student, instructed
also in the three great philosophic systems,
and, later, introduced to Buddhism, he had at hand a
great fund of religion, and a variety of hypotheses on
which to meditate. As soon as he began to perceive
that he must find some creed to lean upon, he set
to work consistently to analyze and compare these
different systems. And from that time, when he
felt himself occupied with a real work, the tempests
of his unconquered self came less often, and were far
less fierce, till, by degrees, they ceased entirely, and he
found himself master of his solitude. Now, truth began
to disclose herself to him. Gradually he discovered
that he understood a few things. He perceived
life to be a period of trial and probation. The beginning
and the end are good. One comes into the
world innocent, pure at heart, untroubled by sordid
doubts and fears. One leaves it calmly, having ceased
to desire the things of life. In the interval many
phases hold possession of the soul: ambitions of various
kinds (lusts and loves, for which one pays with
blood and tears), and the worshipping of many idols.
But one by one these break and crumble away. Men perceive
that they are false, and cease to search for them;
and their lack—the loss of riches, power, even love,—are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
not to be felt as evils. The soul is self-sufficient
if it know its god. This is the story of life.</p>

<p>Afterwards came higher considerations:—cause, purpose,
natural law, finality. Deep were Oman’s meditations
on these matters, and strange the answers that
he found. The twenty-five principles of the philosophy
of Kapila he reduced to two—matter and essence.
From the combination of these the universe has
risen. The great fountain of Spirit, situate in the
heart of the rolling worlds, sends forth a constant
spray, each drop of which is a soul, which, entering a
material form, begins its long pilgrimage back, through
imprisoning matter, into the fountain-head again. Into
such form, after long and troubled study, did Oman
work his truths; and then, still unsatisfied with the
infinitude of existence involved in the idea, sought
further solution to unsolvable things.</p>

<p>Six, seven, eight years went by; and Oman was
no longer young. Yet his appearance was still not
that of a man. His face was without any trace of
beard; nor was his expression one borne by world-dwellers.
His eyes glowed with an inward fire.
There were certain lines about his mouth and eyes
that gave his features the droop of constant melancholy.
His form was tall and gaunt; but his fine skin
was still untoughened by exposure to sun and wind.
Save for a cloth about the loins, he now went unclothed,
unconscious of nakedness, exposed to no
observing eyes. His muscles stood well up on his
lean body, for he was a tiller of the soil. In his whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
life there on the mountain he had never known one
day’s sickness; nor did it occur to him to consider
health in the light of good or evil. His solitude had
effect on him in infinite ways; but he kept himself
from forgetting speech by frequently talking aloud.
His thoughts, however, were not at all those of
men. He made companions out of the natural objects
round him, and regarded the phenomena of nature
as beautiful scenes in which he himself had a part.
He called greetings to the rising sun and to the moon,
which looked on him with jovial, distorted face.
Wild creatures that lived in the lower woods—bears,
small, burrowing animals, even snakes, moved near
him without fear and without any threat of battle. During
his long residence in the open, he had never knowingly
injured a single sentient thing; and for this his
reward came in the shape of companionship with the
wild. The tenth year of his mountain solitude had
passed, when, suddenly, all things were changed for
him.</p>

<p>In some mysterious way, how, cannot be explained,
for the rumor could have had no other origin than the
wind, it was spread among the scattering mountain
villages that, on the summit of the Silver Peak, there
dwelt a Chelah, or hermit, of great holiness and wonderful
powers. And thereupon pilgrimages thither began.</p>

<p>The meeting of Oman and the first stranger that
penetrated his solitude was unique. It was more
than ten years since Oman had looked upon the face
of one of his kind or heard the sound of any voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
other than his own. He had for a long time felt
neither need nor desire for companionship; and his
mind had become quite deadened to the necessity of
reëntering the world. One afternoon, returning from
a short walk down the eastern slope after fruit, he
found himself face to face with a man, standing near
the entrance of his cave, who, seeing him, began to
prostrate himself rapidly. Oman stopped perfectly still,
looking at him with wonderment in his face. After
a while, seeing that the holy one did not speak, the
man began:</p>

<p>“O most excellent, reverend sir, accept my worshipful
homage of your learning and holiness. I am
come to ask of you the fate of my wife, who is sick of
the white plague. All doctors I have rejected, and
come to you, on the top of this amazingly high mountain,
to ask your aid. And, that I may not seem
to be wanting in reverence, I bring with me a jade
anklet,—which may the reverend One accept!” and
forthwith he proffered his gift.</p>

<p>Oman looked at him long and steadfastly, striving
to master the emotions that were welling up within
him, the foremost of which seemed to be acute displeasure.
He hesitated also to speak; for he realized,
on listening to the speech of the man, that his own
articulation had become almost unrecognizably altered.
An answer seemed, however, to be a necessity; so, presently,
he nerved himself to the effort, and said, slowly,
with great difficulty:</p>

<p>“Do not bow down before me, O man, nor before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
any being like yourself. Return to your wife and
keep your place beside her bed; nor neglect to obtain
doctors for her in her sickness. I will not take your
gift, for what need have I of jade? Return to your
dwelling and trouble me no more.”</p>

<p>Vainly the man protested, tried propitiation, prayer,
demand. Oman would pretend to no knowledge
concerning the sickness of his wife. But when the
stranger asked for food before beginning his arduous
homeward journey, Oman could not refuse him, but
offered what he had; and, when they had eaten together,
the man continually exclaiming that he was
not worthy of the honor, he departed, unsatisfied,
carrying with him his jade anklet.</p>

<p>Oman was left in a state of great agitation. The
single hour of human companionship had brought
down on him, in a torrent, all the old desires, fears,
worries, hopes, in fine the inevitable emotions of human
life; and he was whirled into the stream of the
old problem. That day, and the next, and three or
four nights, were filled with restlessness. Then, as
time passed, and he found himself unmolested, calm
returned, and the thoughts of the other life faded
again.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the spell had been broken, and he was
not destined to a much longer period of solitude.
Less than a month had passed when another visitor
appeared upon the Silver Peak, this one with no
higher purpose than a desire to look upon the hermit.
He also, however, brought with him a gift, and remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
and ate with Oman, who conversed with him
without much constraint, out of a kind of eager desire
to convince himself that the life of men was really as
troublous as of old. This fellow departed, carrying
with him a glowing report of the tractability of the
holy man, and the great wisdom he had gained from
conversing with him. And this tale destroyed Oman’s
peace; for it brought upon him a perfect deluge of
visitors, of every degree, male and female, whom, in
the beginning, he helplessly received, and gave of
his store of wisdom, replying to their innumerable
questions with the patience of a child. Among these
pilgrims to his shrine were Poussa and her guardian,
who, when they learned that he still dwelt so close
above them, lost no time in seeking him. And Poussa,
indeed, Oman greeted with real pleasure; providing
her with the choicest of his fare, of which he by now
had some variety; for many of his visitors brought
gifts of food, which, his stock of grain running low
under the demand, he perforce accepted. Moreover,
he was now clad in a new robe, finer of texture and
richer as to border than any he had ever worn. From
Poussa, however, he would accept nothing, reminding
her that she had long since made him her debtor for
what he could never repay. And the girl and her
guardian left the mountain top after promising to
repeat their visit.</p>

<p>For some weeks, buoyed up by the thought of
genuine friendship, Oman continued to let himself be
seen, treated his visitors with courtesy, and occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
accepted some of their gifts. But after another month
of it, he grew sick of the servility of his visitors and
the transparent curiosity with which they regarded
him; and, taking with him only a pouch full of grain
from his small store, he disappeared into the forest of
the east slope, and remained there for a fortnight, till
hunger drove him home again. It was sunset of an
October day when he reappeared upon the height, and,
arriving at his cave, found it already tenanted. Across
the threshold, motionless, unconscious, lay the body of
an old man, shrunken and pitiably emaciated, clad in a
tattered robe, a much-used staff lying at his side.</p>

<p>Oman’s anger at sight of the intruder quickly melted
to pity. Kneeling beside the prostrate body, he lifted
one of the limp hands and began to chafe it back to
warmth. This being of no avail, he hurried to the
spring, returning with a wooden vessel full of water,
which he sprinkled upon the worn face and poured
down the parched throat. It had its effect. The
stranger stirred uneasily, muttered a few words, and
suddenly opened his eyes. Oman, with a momentary
throb of memory, perceived that one of these eyes was
brown, and the other a faded blue.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_Xb">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE WANDERER</small></h3>
</div>


<p>For a long moment Oman bent close over the intruder,
staring into those strange orbs, his mind groping
back, back, into the dim past, wondering where it
was that he had known them before. Then, as the old
man uttered a faint moan, he started to himself again,
asking anxiously:</p>

<p>“You are better? You can speak?”</p>

<p>“I am better. Help me—to rise,” answered the
other, feebly.</p>

<p>Oman, newly compassionate, lifted the light form in
his arms, carried it farther into the cave, and laid the
unbidden guest upon his own grass bed in the far corner.
Then he set about the tedious task of making a
fire. Before his sticks were ready, however, the newcomer,
summoning him, in a high and querulous voice,
to the bed, gave him a flint and steel, and a piece of
inflammable substance that he carried in his pouch.
These Oman thankfully made use of, and presently
a fire burned again in the rude habitation. Then,
out of his stores, the hermit prepared a meal for both
of them: rice and dried fruits, which, with fresh water,
formed a repast that seemed luxurious enough in Oman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
eyes. When it was ready he approached the stranger,
and asked gently if he desired to be fed. For answer
the old man drew himself into a sitting posture, and
then, after a moment’s effort, rose to his feet, walked
to the fire, and sat down; but before Oman had placed
his portion of the meal before him, he looked into the
young man’s face, and said, in a harsh and trembling
tone:</p>

<p>“This is charity that you give. I cannot repay you
for the shelter. I am a mendicant, old, feeble, very
near to death.”</p>

<p>“And I am a hermit. The lonely have need of little.
What I possess, therefore, I will share with you.”</p>

<p>So they began their meal. It was a silent one. The
stranger did not make any effort to talk; and Oman,
watching him, sank by degrees into a fit of abstraction
in which his memory moved, groping, searching, wandering
back through time to find the clew to his
recognition of this man. The stranger himself, though
probably he had been in a half-starved condition,
showed no great eagerness for his food. He ate slowly
and little, and seemed to droop forward, while he sat,
with the weariness of age; and Oman began to wonder
how he had ever reached such a height as the Silver Peak.</p>

<p>While they sat there at their meal, the sun set, and the
swift twilight faded. And when the old man rose and
moved toward the mouth of the cave, the stars were
shining, close overhead. After gazing for a moment at
the shadowy lines of hills stretching away to the east
and west, the old man turned to his host, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>“I will go out now and spend the night upon the
mountain. For the hospitality you have given me, I
thank you, in the name of Siva.”</p>

<p>“Out upon the mountain! Why, thou wilt perish
there! The nights are cold at this height. Nay,
surely my cave is large enough for two. Remain here
till dawn, at least, O stranger.”</p>

<p>The old man turned on him those peculiar eyes, in
which there now lurked an expression of suspicion, of
craftiness, of secrecy:—the expression of a dotard;
and there was an evil smile upon the old, trembling lips
as he said: “No, no. I shall sleep alone. There is no
one to prevent me. Hermit, it is thirty years since I
slept in a human habitation. No, no. No one shall
get the better of me in my sleep. No, no. And look
you,” his tone grew querulously savage, “look you
that you do not try to seek out my bed!” As he
spoke these last words, one hand crept up to a string
that was about his throat, its end lost under his robe,
and the other went to his girdle, wherein a knife was
stuck.</p>

<p>Believing him now to be insane, Oman made no
further protest; and the man, with another look at him,
went out into the darkness of the eastern slope, with a
step that tottered with weakness.</p>

<p>Amazed by the strange incident, Oman turned into
his cave again, and, worn out with many days of privation
and discomfort, lay down to sleep. All night his
dreams were troubled. The personality of the old man
had laid strong hold upon him, and he appeared in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
sleep: now in the guise of some grewsome spirit of evil,
now as a guardian angel shielding him from mysterious
dangers. Oman woke at dawn, troubled and scarcely
refreshed, the old man still uppermost in his thoughts.
Possibly he had been feverish through the night; for his
mouth was parched, and he longed for water. In the
cool twilight of new day he rose, crossed the open plateau,
and went a little down the eastern slope to the
spring. As he reached his destination, his ear caught
a faint sound that came from some distance to the
right:—the sound of a human voice, moaning, as if
from pain.</p>

<p>Oman hurriedly started toward it; and, after some
moments’ search, came upon the body of the wanderer,
lying in a smooth space surrounded by trees. His
eyes were closed, his color ghastly, and, from his parted
lips there came, with every breath, the deep moan that
had drawn Oman thither. The hermit knelt beside
his strange visitor and lifted one of the cold hands.
At the touch, the prostrate one opened his eyes, as it
were with an effort. Seeing Oman beside him, he
murmured, with a suggestion of relief in his tone:</p>

<p>“Hermit—is it thou?” and immediately relapsed
into a state of semi-consciousness.</p>

<p>Oman did, at once, the only thing to be done. Lifting
the body in his arms again, he carried it up the
slope and back into the cave, where the fire still smouldered;
and, laying the old man again on his grass bed,
began to work over him.</p>

<p>The day passed without his returning to a normal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
state. Oman knew that he was very ill, but whether
with some disease, or simply as the result of old age
and exposure, he could not tell. He warmed him, fed
him, bathed his brows with water, and sometimes caught
what he took to be a murmur of gratitude from the
feeble lips. As night came on, he began to fear lest the
stranger should make some attempt to leave him again;
but the fear proved groundless. With the setting of
the sun, a hot fever rose in the aged and world-weary
body. The sick one’s mind wandered through far-off
regions, and he talked, loudly, of fragmentary things.
For Oman there was no sleep that night. With a great
pity for the helplessness of his guest, he watched over
him tenderly, doing for him those things that only a
woman would have thought of. During that night of
anxiety, there rose up in the heart of the hermit something
that for many years he had been striving vainly
to kill. It was the hunger for human love and affection,
a desire for something to care for. Suddenly, this
last had been given him. This old man, querulous,
evil-eyed, unlovable bodily and mentally, had become
sacred in his eyes, an object of trust for which he
should be answerable; and, in this thought, all the
starved affection in Oman’s nature welled up within
him, till his heart was full and overflowing with pain
and joy.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day of the stranger’s
illness came the rains; and Oman knew that now, for
the space of a month, at least, they were safe from
intrusion. He and his charge were alone at the mercy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
of Nature; and, far from being dismayed at the prospect,
Oman hailed it with joy. For him, who was now
become veritably the mountain’s child, the old fear of
the tempest was quite gone. Lightning and wind and
rain were his brothers, when they sported across the
peaks; and, since they brought him security against the
impertinence of the people of the valleys, he blessed
them anew for their presence. Thus, relieved from
any untoward anxiety, he turned with all his strength
and all his will to the assistance of the worn and
world-weary creature whom chance or God had sent
him to be his charge.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Oman always hoped that a few
days would see the old man recovering, in some measure,
his strength. But little by little that hope faded
away. The illness, however, was never very alarming.
By night there was always low fever, by day sometimes
an abnormal chilliness, which Oman frequently strove
to overcome by the heat of his own body. He would
lie by the hour stretched along the bed, clasping the
old form to his own, literally feeding his strength into
the other. The stranger never tried his patience, at
least. He was perfectly passive, obeyed every suggestion
of his guardian, ate and drank whatever was
given him, and never asked for more. Much of the
time, indeed, Oman was in doubt as to whether he knew
what was going on around him. By night his mind
wandered, and he talked in his dreams; but by day he
generally lay like one in a stupor, heeding nothing that
passed. The one hour when he seemed to regain possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
of his faculties, was at sunset. Usually, at this
time, he would open his eyes, and, if Oman were not
already beside him, would call for him, and ask a few
questions, or address him on topics of interest to himself,
the significance of which was lost on his listener.
For a few days, just at first, he would often ask to sleep
apart from his companion, would suggest vague dangers
that were surrounding him, and certain suspicious circumstances
that he believed himself to have noticed.
From the general tenor of this talk, Oman gathered that
he was in constant fear of being robbed; and, from
watching the hands that were forever fumbling and
playing with the string about his neck, he guessed that
this string must be attached to the object of his anxiety.
He was, therefore, scrupulously careful never to mention,
and, so far as was possible, not even to look at this
string; and the result of his consideration was what he
hoped for:—very soon the old man dropped his suspicions,
and seemed to feel for Oman a spirit of friendliness,
almost affection.</p>

<p>The latter half of October and the first fortnight in
November were wild weeks on the mountain top. It
seemed as if the very elements were struggling over
that soul in the cave. Never had such storms of hail,
rain, wind, and snow raged round the Silver Peak. In
all that time, however, Oman’s weaker nature never
once manifested itself. He was using all the man and
all the strength in him for the wanderer, whom the
wild weather greatly disturbed. Indeed, often, during
the storms, he would lie cowering with terror in his far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
corner of the shelter, talking deliriously of strange
things, or uttering wild and terrified cries that wrung
Oman’s very heart.</p>

<p>It was early in the afternoon of a mid-November day
that one of the fiercest of these storms began, and
lasted till early evening, when a great and unexpected
peace descended upon the earth. Remarkably, the
working of Nature was paralleled within the cave by
an inexplicable scene. All through the morning the
stranger had been conscious, sane, and unusually tranquil.
After the noon meal he lay back on his bed with
the avowed intention of sleeping; and Oman seated
himself in the doorway of the hut, to watch the clouds
roll up from the west and swirl close round the
peak, in moisture-laden mists. For some moments the
storm had been imminent; and Oman’s nerves were
keyed for the first rush of the wind. His back was
toward the bed. He could not know that the figure of
the old man was suddenly upright. He could not see
the fire of madness burning in the weird eyes, nor perceive
that the shrunken muscles were as tense as those
of a panther about to spring. But, in the first roar of
the blast, with the first, fierce sweep of hail across
the mountain top, the storm within also broke. Oman
felt himself seized about the throat in an iron grip,
and heard the shouting of the madman above the fury
of the gale.</p>

<p>The half hour that followed he never clearly remembered.
There was a fierce, almost mortal struggle.
Locked in each other’s arms, the two reeled and rolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
about the cave, like animals. Oman fought simply to
preserve himself; but he was pitted against a madman’s
strength. Blinded and half-stunned by the suddenness
of the attack, it was many minutes before he got
full control of his own forces. He soon became aware
that a flood of wild ravings was pouring from the old
man’s lips; and finally, at the very climax of the battle,
when Oman felt his strength giving way, the wanderer
suddenly dropped his arms, and his maniacal force
seemed to throw itself into words, which he screamed
out till they sounded high above the gush and clamor
of the storm:</p>

<p>“Thou shalt not have it—thou shalt not, dog!
Nor thou! Nor thou!—It is mine! The Asra ruby
is mine own, given me in payment for work.—Ah—ye
shall not take it from me! Faces—faces—faces!”</p>

<p>The last words sank, grewsomely, to a whisper, as
he struck out once and again into the air at the phantom
forms that closed him round. Then, suddenly,
without any warning, he flung both hands over his head,
reeled, and dropped in a heap at Oman’s side.</p>

<p>For a moment or two the hermit stood perfectly still,
exhausted by the struggle that had passed. Then he
took the unconscious man by the arms, and dragged and
pulled him back to the bed, on which he placed him,
limp and unresisting. Afterwards he went to replenish
the fire, over which he busied himself for some minutes.
Finally he returned to the doorway, and seated
himself so that he could watch both the bed and the
world without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>He was thoroughly tired. He could not remember
ever experiencing such a battle as the one just passed;
and it had taken all his strength. In the corner, the
stranger had now begun to moan, faintly; but Oman
made no move to go to him. Just now he felt no desire
to help a creature who had so lately attempted his life.
Rather, there was a new bitterness in him. Had it not
been always thus—a return of evil for good? This
was all that unselfishness or self-sacrifice had ever
brought him. Where was the divine justice to be
found? Where was that universal law of compensation?
Alas! Experience was once more accomplishing
its work, narrowing its victim down to the little
present, blotting out all the breadth of view that reflection
and solitude had brought.</p>

<p>For many hours Oman sat there, musing bitterly, till
the cloud-veiled sun was down, and night, still filled
with the rush of tempest, advanced. Then, at last, he
turned within, replenished his fire, and cooked himself
a meal of rice. As he ate, he glanced over toward the
stranger, who, however, made no sign. When he had
finished, Oman crept quietly to the bed, and looked
down at his charge, to see if he had need of anything.
But he found the old man fast asleep.</p>

<p>After a time he returned to his post in the doorway.
He found the night changed. Through torn and shimmering
mists, the golden moon came rolling up out of
the hills, bringing with her a court of stars, and driving
the heavier clouds away down the western slope of the
sky. Peace had come upon the height. The ruin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
wrought by the storm was being atoned for now. It
was the hour of Nature’s repentance. Oman looked,
and his own soul grew calm. This scene was so familiar
to him! How many times, in his long sojourn on
the height, had he not gazed upon it thus, gloried in it,
loved it? But to-night, when its mission had been accomplished,
and he had been restored to tranquillity, he
turned his thought to other things—one other thing:—a
strange, foreboding sense of recognition of some of
the words spoken by the wanderer: “The Asra ruby
is mine own—given me in payment—” And it was
Oman himself who involuntarily added, in thought,
the last words that his charge had uttered: “Faces!
Faces! Faces!” What were the faces rising round
him here, in the firelit night? What pale ghosts of
the long ago were taking shape? What was it now
burning behind his brain, struggling to break the barrier
of the past? Oman bent his head, and clasped it in his
two hands, thinking in vain, yet ever with the sense
that remembrance was imminent. He was at a high
pitch of nervousness when the unwelcome voice reached
his ears:—a voice faint, and weak, and low, as if it
came out of the depths of the bygone years:</p>

<p>“Hermit—art thou there?”</p>

<p>With a passing shiver, Oman rose and went to the
bed where the old man lay. As he approached, the
stranger lifted one hand slightly, and murmured:</p>

<p>“Fear not, hermit. I am not now mad. Nay—all
things are clear before me, for I am approached by
Rama.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>Oman knelt beside him, and gazed earnestly into the
gaunt, white-bearded face, across which the fire cast a
flickering light that brought out every smallest line
and wrinkle. An ashen pallor pinched his features,
giving them the unmistakable, waxen look that comes
only to those whose souls are poised for flight. Oman
saw at once that death was near; and his heart contracted,
painfully:</p>

<p>“Yes,—thou seest it,” said the wanderer, quietly, as
he looked into Oman’s eyes. “It is time. My spirit
is glad of its release.”</p>

<p>He lapsed into silence again; nor had Oman any
desire to break the stillness over which, as he knew,
Rama brooded. The wanderer retained his consciousness:
seemed, indeed, to be lost in a revery, while
Oman sat watching him. After a time, in the course
of his musing, the dying man’s hand crept up to that
string which was about his neck; nor, this time, did his
touch stop with the string. With an air of delivering
himself of a heavy secret, he drew, from beneath his
loose garment, a tiny, golden box. Lifting this in his
thumb and first finger, he turned his face to Oman, and
began to speak, disjointedly, at first, as if he were
thinking aloud; then, by degrees, launching into narrative
form, with a story that held Oman spell-bound at
his side.</p>

<p>“Look—it is here,” he observed, quietly. “Here is
the Asra ruby; the great stone that I have kept my own
for thirty years. Here it is, in this box, safe to the end.
And Fidá is gone—and I cannot—See, hermit! It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
lies in this little box, that treasure. Thou hast never
made move to take it from me since I have dwelt with
thee; and therefore it shall be thine after my death. Yes,
I have said it. Thine. But take it not from me until
I have passed. Dost thou hear, hermit?” His tone
grew threatening and harsh. “I am dying, and thou
mayest take it from me dead.” He glared again into
Oman’s face; but, seeing the gentle expression there,
lost his sudden angry fear, and dropped again into the
lighter tone.</p>

<p>“The years—the years are many since it came to
me. I was not then a young man; and I had done
much wrong in the world. My name—no one knows
it now. I have never told it since that night. But
I may speak it at last. My name is Churi, and I was
a slave, a doctor, in the palace of Mandu.”</p>

<p>“Mandu!” echoed Oman, quickly, in a strange
tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was a doctor there, as well as a slave; and
I was valued and trusted by my Rajah. But I wanted
my freedom. I planned to buy my freedom, that I
might no longer be called ‘slave’. And then Fidá
was brought thither. The Rajah, returning from war
in the north, brought back a noble captive who was
made royal cup-bearer, and afterwards raised to high
favor in the palace. But Fidá loved. Ha! He
loved a woman of the zenana—not a slave, mind, but
a wife, and the <i>favorite</i> wife. And she loved him also.
And because I guarded a door of the zenana by night,
he gave me the ruby to open the door to him. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
I, hoping by it to buy my freedom, accepted it, knowing
that it was the life of his race.”</p>

<p>“This man—his name,” suggested Oman, trembling
a little.</p>

<p>“His name?—I have said it,—Fidá el-Asra. That
was his name; and the gem was the gem of the Asra.
When he gave it away, he became cursed; and the evil
fell on all of us. For many weeks I sanctioned the
crime in the zenana: for months played I traitor to my
Rajah, for the sake of the ruby, and because I loved
Fidá and Ahalya, and because they were happy together.
Then at last the slave fell sick of a sickness
that would not be cured, though I even returned the
ruby to him to be worn, in order that he might be well
again. But it could not help him then; and he gave
it back to me.</p>

<p>“It was spring. I hoped daily for the coming
of a certain merchant to whom I would sell the ruby
for the price of my freedom. But alas! freedom and
vengeance came upon me together, without the selling
of the stone. There was a new war. Rai-Khizar-Pál
marched away, leaving his favorite slave to be guardian
of the young lord Bhavani, his son. Then, in the
fair April, it fell upon us:—death! death! death!</p>

<p>“We found it in the early dawn,—Kasya and I.
We found the body of Ragunáth, dead, in the champak
bushes, by the water-palace. He was lying in his
blood.—And Ahalya and Fidá had not come back from
him. They were gone. Soon everything must be
known; and I should surely be betrayed to my death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
when Kasya learned the things that I had done; for
there was a little Arab slave—Ahmed—who also
knew. Therefore, by night, I stole away from Mandu,
and out—out—into the hills, carrying the ruby with
me. Blood was upon it. Blood it had brought, and
with the fire of blood it gleamed. I dared not part
with it. It ate into my flesh, and yet I could not sell
it. I suffered from heat and from cold, from hunger
and thirst and nakedness, while I bore on my body
this great wealth. For thirty years, hermit, I have
wandered over the earth, carrying fear with me. Each
man has worn for me the mask of Rama. Each bite of
food has had for me the flavor of poison. I have
wandered the Vindhyas over, from east to west, from
Dumoh to Khambot. And ever Mandu has drawn
me back toward her. Terror and death have dogged
my footsteps; yet have I lived long, till I am very old.
Suffering, hardship, sickness, most hideous remorse—all
these I have known, and still have clung to life.
My spirit was broken long ago; but I have not wanted
to die. I should have fought with any that threatened
to take life from me. Tell me, Wise One, what is this
love of living? Why have I, most miserable of creatures,
clung so long to it?</p>

<p>“But behold—behold—the face of Rama stares at
me, from the shadow yonder! Back, Rama! Back
yet for a little! Back!” For a second, the old man
lifted himself from the bed, and levelled a tremulous
hand at the haunting visage. Then he fell, weakly,
and for a long time was still. Oman, sitting beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
him, still under the spell, could not speak. Finally
Churi himself broke the silence again, this time in a
voice that had faded to a thin whisper:</p>

<p>“I am dying, hermit. Rama’s face grows brighter
in the gloom. The visage is less fearful, now. My
madness is gone. I see clearly. But for many years
I have been mad. It is the ruby. It holds evil in it for
all but the race of Asra. I had dreamed of returning
it to them. But thou, who hast sheltered me and fed
me, to thee I say: the ruby is cursed. I warn thee of
it. Better burn it on my body.—Hark!—hark!—the
drums of Rama! I am dying, hermit. Take me
by the hand!”</p>

<p>Feebly he held out his shrunken fingers, and Oman
clasped them close and steadied him. Then Rama and
his hosts came by, and halted for a moment at the cave
till their number was joined by one. Thereafter they
moved on again, beating their muffled drums. And
Oman was left alone on the Silver Peak, with the body
of Churi, the dying fire, and the gem, enclosed in its
golden box. Long Oman sat there, beside the body of
the vagabond, thinking. Finally, when the dawn was
still three hours away, he rose and made ready for his
task. But first, perhaps unconscious of what he did,
he loosened the treasure from the stiffening fingers of
the dead, and slipped the string, with its yellow box,
about his own neck.</p>

<small>SUNRISE</small></h3>
</div>


<p>By night, on the eastern slope, Oman, under the light
of the stars and moon, built a great funeral pyre of dry
wood, brought from his store in the cave. There was in
it neither sandal nor aloes, nor yet frankincense, nor any
fragrant spice to cover the stench of burning human
flesh. But the dry fagots would blaze high and fast;
and the gay flames would quickly purify the long-tenanted
body. When all was ready, Oman returned to
the cave, and, lifting the still form of the old man, bore
it out into the air of heaven and laid it on the pyre, its
face turned toward the west, where the moon was now
quietly sinking. Then, with a blazing stick brought
from the cave, he lighted the funeral pyre and stood
watching the flame-wreath that rose in a halo round the
hoary head.</p>

<p>To an Indian, this purification by fire is no infamy,
nor is there anything horrible in it. It is his sacred
ceremony for the beloved dead. While Oman made his
preparations for it, he had suffered no repulsion. And
yet now, as he watched the dead form—so pinched, so
pallid, so unreal, lying complacently on the great fire-bed,
with the flames curling around the flesh: now, as
the long beard and white hair were singed away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
and the blackened visage grinned in horrid baldness, a
thrill shot through Oman’s breast, and, stifling a cry, he
turned and ran from the spot, up, up, through the wood,
and into the open, on the height. There he threw
himself down, beside a giant boulder, and, burying his
head in his arms, gave himself up to a new repulsion and
a new heart-sickness.</p>

<p>The moon had set; and the world was very still. The
crackling of the fire and the hiss that went with it were
the only audible sounds. Animal noises had ceased.
A far, faint breeze stirred the tree-tops; but there was
no suggestion of the fierce rains of the previous day.
The whole sky was softly luminous with waning moon-
light and the redoubled splendor of stars. Far below,
the valleys and the base of the hills were lightly swathed
in mist. Peace brooded over the great Vindhyas; and
gradually Oman’s horror was swept away. The sweet
night air cooled his frame and dried the tears that
had wet his face. Weariness overcame his excitement
at the events of the day and night; and he fell into a
kind of stupor. He was not asleep, for he was still
conscious of the workings of nature:—the setting of
the moon, the dark hour, the dying glow of the fire,
whose work was done, and the heavy wheeling through
the sky of two or three night birds. His brain, however,
was numb. He neither thought, nor felt the desire
to think. His head rested against the rock, and his eyes
closed. An hour passed; and, by degrees, the darkness
gave way to a faint, shadowy light. The night was
over. Day was at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>In this first grayness, Oman lifted his head and opened
his eyes. Then he rose and looked down to the wood,
where the fire had been. For a moment he hesitated,
but finally turned away. He could not go there yet.
For a few moments he paced up and down the broad,
treeless space on the height, and then returned to his
rock, and set his face to the wondrous east.</p>

<p>The far horizon was streaked with palest rose and
yellow, melting into a shadowy sky. Above this bed
of color, the starry rushlights one by one melted away.
Only the morning star, the jewel in Ushas’ frontlet,
remained, flashing in the now deepening crimson, till
Ushas herself, having opened the sun-gates, passed from
the sky and returned into the land of the gods. The
colors were intensified as new light crept up the heavens;
and above the gold was a band of pale, clear green
that merged softly into the upper blue. Now, down the
slope, and over all the wooded hillsides, rose a musical
murmur, the song of waking things: birds, and insects.
And fearlessly they performed the morning hymn, undisturbed
by any thought of man. By now the creatures
of the jungle had returned to their lairs, the
night’s prowling ended; and the world was waking
from dread to the joy of new day.</p>

<p>There was a long, still pause. The clear light grew
clearer, the crimson deepened with inner fire, two or
three little cloud-boats near the horizon were gay with
rosy glow; but the shimmering valley mists had passed
quietly away. The world was ready and waiting.
Yet still Surya, rejoicing in the magnificence of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
pageantry, delayed his coming, till the man upon the
mountain top, impatient of the time, bethought him of
his treasure, pulled the golden box from beneath his robe,
opened it, and let the contents fall into his hand. The
ruby seemed a talisman; for, as Oman held the clear
stone against the sky, the first fire-beam shot above the
horizon, and the great, flaming wheel rolled up from
behind a far-off hill. The world broke into the climax
of its morning song; and, in his heart, Oman also sang:
strange words, fitted to a wondrous melody. Then,
by degrees, he was silent again, his eyes, lowered from
the too dazzling light, fixed upon the fiery heart of
Churi’s legacy—the Asra ruby.</p>

<p>As Oman gazed into the scintillating depths of this
rare and wonderful stone, he was thrown into a kind of
waking slumber, a trance, in which scenes of a dim-lit
past crowded upon him. Churi’s tale returned:—the
young prince in captivity, who had bought his love
with this stone:—Fidá el-Asra. Oman saw him, clearly,
standing in a small and richly furnished room, beside a
woman clad in clinging, scarlet draperies, a wreath of
poppies woven in her heavy hair. This woman’s face
grew more distinct, and shone almost transparent, till,
as she gazed into the face of the man, a faint smile
lighted her lips. But there was a mournful sadness in
her lustrous eyes; and, seeing these eyes, Oman’s heart
throbbed with understanding.</p>

<p>This man and this woman, burning in the depths
of the ruby, were no vision. Nay, he knew them
both: <i>he</i>, Oman, the outcast, the hermit. But how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
explain the reality of the dream? Had he sheltered the
twain in his own breast? How else came he to know
their suffering: to suffer with them? How else was it
that he saw the dark shadow of crime lying on both
their hearts? How else that a gurgle and rush of
water sounded in his ears, and that he shuddered as
he felt the chilly contact? How else could he realize
the terror of helplessness that had been upon these two
souls, as they rose together from the embracing waters,
to that space where water could not hide their deed?
How, finally, was it that, straightway after this, he was
himself again, standing upon the height where his battle
had been fought and won, and where the vision had appeared?
The jewel was still glowing in his fingers; the
sun was only just upon the edge of the horizon;—but he
had lived a year in three minutes. Did this mendicant’s
gem hold within it some baleful magic? With a sudden
sense of revulsion he dropped the ruby back into
its box, thrust it out of sight under his robe, and, shaking
away the still clinging dream, walked slowly back
into his cave.</p>

<p>Fortunately his fire had not quite gone out; and, with
a little effort, he revived it. Then he cooked himself
some food, ate, threw himself upon the bed where
Churi had died, and fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, it was afternoon. Clouds were
rolling up the west, and there was promise of more
rain. Oman went slowly out of his cave, with a new
sense of desolation on him. The air was cold. The
surrounding hills lay wrapped in still, gray shadows.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
All the morning joy had left the world. Reluctantly,
with dread in his heart, Oman made his way down the
eastern slope to the place of the funeral pyre. There
lay a heap of wood ashes, mingled with white bones,
a few scraps of cloth, and some pieces of charred and
blackened flesh. That was all. The fire had done its
work well. A week of rains and wind, and no trace
would remain of him who had ascended the Silver Peak
to die. The sight was less dreadful than Oman had
feared; and he returned to his cave with a lighter heart.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the daylight, Oman occupied
himself in a desultory way by reviewing his depleted resources.
His fire-wood was nearly gone; and, the woods
around being soaked with rains, it would be a month or
more before a new stock could be gathered and sufficiently
dried to burn. His food supply was also very
low. This fall he had neglected to care for his grain
field; and the crop, which, by this time, should have been
harvested, still lay in the soil, draggled with mud and
mildewed with wet. He had yet a little millet from
the last season, and some rice and dried dates brought
by visitors, before the rains. But, fast as he might, these
could not suffice for the winter. Tired and heavy-hearted,
he sat in the doorway of his cave and watched
night and the storm come on together. Then, while
the rain beat into his shelter, and a fierce wind raged
without, he rekindled his fire in the farthest corner of
the cave, and lay down upon his grass bed, thinking
to sleep.</p>

<p>But rest was not yet for him. By degrees he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
seized with a great restlessness of mind and body. He
tossed and turned, nor was able to shut his eyes, which
stared wide into the light-streaked gloom. His brain
burned, and was filled with chaotic visions. The spirit
of Churi moved close beside him; and he chilled with
dread. Where was the calm of his former high estate?
Alas! It had of late become a mockery. On his breast
the ruby burned; and at length he took it out and
gazed at it by the light of the fire. Again it brought
upon him strange thoughts, bathed him in a stream of
remembrances so vivid that he felt himself of another
life. Under this influence, after a long time, he fell
asleep, only to find his dreams taking the same direction
as his waking visions. He found himself standing on
a great eminence, a vast plateau, rising sheer out of
a fertile plain. Behind him were rice-fields, trees,
running water, and vast buildings. He was standing
with his back to one of these buildings, which was
half hidden in clustering tamarinds and bamboo; and
the structure was called, in his dream, the water-palace.
In the dying light of day he stood there, looking down
over the far plain, to a broad river that rushed through
the fields. His old calm was upon him, for he was at
home. This, he perceived, was the land of his desire,
the place where he should find welcome and rest. And
so the vision faded and his sleep became dreamless.</p>

<p>When he awoke, the morning was well along. He
found that he still clasped the ruby in his right hand;
and, returning it to its box, he prepared to go about the
duties of his day. He was determined now to force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
himself to a long period of reflection, as a remedy for
the restlessness brought about by recent happenings.
But, to his great disturbance, he found his determination
easier made than carried out. True, he meditated. Long
habit had not so basely deserted him. But his meditations
were no longer satisfying, and, when they were
over, the dreaded mood, a restless loneliness, an unquenchable
yearning, crept upon him again, till he
soothed himself anew with thoughts of the ruby, the
power of which never failed.</p>

<p>All this could end only in one way. For three weeks
longer he dwelt on his height; and then, suddenly abandoning
a useless battle, made ready to leave the mountain
top. At dawn of a December day he stood for the
last time on the summit where he had dwelt for so
many years; and then, at last, not without a pang of
regret, he turned his steps downward, toward the haunts
of men.</p>

<small>MANDU IN MALWA</small></h3>
</div>


<p>Late in the evening of the same day that he had left
the height, Oman appeared at the door of Poussa’s hut;
and found that the years had changed it little. Poussa,
now a woman of some authority in the village, though
she was not yet thirty, received him with joyful acclaim,
and with a reverence that she gave neither to the
head-man nor to the priest of her community. She
feasted him on rice and curry, millet bread, dried fruits,
and sweetmeats, and gave him to drink out of a jar of
mellow (not too precious) wine. They ate alone, he
and she; and he slept the whole night in her hut before
she deigned to acquaint the village that the great hermit
was among them.</p>

<p>Oman, who had expected to spend the next day at
the loom, to pay his debt of food to Poussa, found himself,
instead, a centre of attraction to the whole village,
and was obliged to submit, for a matter of twelve hours,
to the entertainment of the chief citizens of the hamlet,
and as many visitors as had time to reach him that day.
At dusk he was borne to the room of the gods in an old
palanquin, carried on the shoulders of eager Vaisyas.
And there a sacrifice was conducted, and Soma was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
drunk, and fires were lighted in the council square.
They also demanded of him an address; and Oman
talked, preaching a little of his own creed, couched in
the simplest language. His audience, accustomed, like
all Hindoos, to thoughts of the broadest abstraction, gave
close attention, and, getting his meaning, approved it,
because of the novelty of his ideas. Later he was borne
back, triumphant, to Poussa’s hut.</p>

<p>That night Oman could not sleep for very joy. Here
at last was—success. At last men had given him free
right of brotherhood, and more. He had known the
respect, the reverence, of his own kind. By a miracle,
the outcast was become the acclaimed among men.
The cost of it, those bitter years of loneliness and
despair, was not counted now. Oman knew only that
he was welcome, was honored among the people; and
his heart went out to them in praise and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he stayed only a day longer in this
mountain hamlet. His departure was not easy.
Through Poussa it had become known that he was
Brahman-born; and immediately a post as second priest
was offered him by Nala himself. Here Oman might
have ended his days, universally revered and beloved.
But Fate was pulling at his sleeve. The yearning for
the dreamland, the land of the Ruby, had not left him;
and his heart told him that it actually existed, while
Fate whispered in his ear, bidding him go find it.
Thus, obedient to the voice, he said farewell to his new
friends, detached Poussa’s clinging hands from his
knees, smoothed the rough hair back from her face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
pressed his lips to her brow, and then set off, alone, into
the jungle.</p>

<p>Now began his period of wandering:—the long
progress through the Vindhyas, which occupied many
months. It was not a time of suffering. Long inured
to the greatest hardships of the body, neither fatigue
nor hunger dismayed him, nor did the mountain woods
and ravines hold for him any terror. The animals of
the wild would not molest him. Indeed, he encountered
singularly few. The winter weather was pleasant; the
sun’s rays mild. With a stout wooden staff in his hand,
he journeyed leisurely, halting at any villages he came
to, finding welcome and acclaim wherever he arrived;
for his appearance proclaimed his estate. It became his
regular custom to preach in the market-place; and he
never lacked an audience. Perhaps from the memory
of Hushka, perhaps out of the depths of his own solitude,
he had drawn a kind of picturesque eloquence
that rushed upon him as he began his talks, and drew
his listeners to him like a magnet. An Indian will
listen to any fantastic creed, interest himself in any
philosophy, nor deem it heresy to his million gods. It
is, with him, either the instinctive knowledge that Truth
in any form is good; or else, and more probably, a kind
of inconsequential, dreamer’s grasping of all happily
expressed maxims that bear the stamp of understanding.
At this time, Oman made no attempt to get to the root
of his success. It was enough for him that it existed.
Joy walked with him on the road; and the stimulus of
his popularity seemed to know no reaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>Fortunately, he never felt any desire to take up a
permanent abode in these mountain towns. Some of
them were of fair size, boasted of a petty ruler, and
had some military force. Many had open offices for
such as he, where he might have taken a place of rank.
Almost all were set in surroundings of great natural
beauty, calculated to appeal strongly to Oman’s inbred
love of nature. But he never entertained the least idea
of settling in one of them. His early purpose, vague as
it was, lay enshrined in his heart. He was a pilgrim to
the land of vision and memory: a high and holy place,
peopled with ghosts of beloved dead, a shrine that all
twice-born love to carry in their hearts. For months
he hid his desire. He longed constantly to make inquiry
of the men among whom he passed, but he
always hesitated, fearing to be taken for a fool should
he speak of a country the name of which he could not
tell, and no part of which he could definitely describe.</p>

<p>The winter months drew along pleasantly; but, with
the coming of spring and the thought of the hot weather,
his restlessness and the vision in his heart grew, till
one day he was driven to speech. He was walking
through a narrow valley, a long strip of which had
been recently ploughed for the first time; and a man
was at work there, sowing millet. On the edge of the
field Oman paused, till the farmer, bag at belt, right arm
working mechanically in and out, came slowly toward
him, and then halted.</p>

<p>“Fair spring and a rich crop to thee!” said Oman.</p>

<p>“Alas! It is too late in the year for a heavy crop!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
But a peaceful journey to thee, reverend sir,” returned
the man, civilly.</p>

<p>Then Oman, resolutely putting away his fears, began,
in haste: “Friend, I am seeking a far country:—a
kingdom that lies on the edge of the hills, high in the
sunlight, while below it are a broad plain and a great
river. Canst thou tell me the name of such a place?”</p>

<p>The man looked at him, first surprised, and then
puzzled, but not asking a closer description. “A high
kingdom,” he muttered, knitting his brow. Oman’s
chance words had caught his imagination. “Ah! Perhaps—there
is a plateau, lying five days’ journey to
the west and south, that is called Mandu—”</p>

<p>“Mandu! Mandu! It is the name! Churi said it!
Tell me, stranger, tell me again! The place lies west
and south? A plateau! Thou hast been there?”</p>

<p>The farmer shook his head. “Nay, I am newly come
from the north. But traders and mendicants have
spoken of it. It is well known:—a Rajah’s land. South
of it, below, is the Narmáda, the holy stream. Doubtless
thou wouldst bathe there. But Mandu, I have
been told, is to be reached from the mountains by a
causeway. Yes, I have heard much of that place.”</p>

<p>Oman’s face was alight, and he longed for money
wherewith to repay the man for his information. The
farmer, however, expected no such unusual thing as
money out of a mendicant, and hoped for no more than
a blessing from this one, which he got. Then Oman
passed on, his face turned to the southwest.</p>

<p>For five days, and more than five, he journeyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
toward the sunset. He was all aflame with eagerness
and delight; but he would ask his way no more. He
had a strange notion that it would be a shame to him
were he unable, now, to find the country of his heart’s
desire; and he kept his eagerness within himself, never
allowing himself to say to any one the words that burned
on his lips: “I go south, to Mandu! To the plateau
of Mandu!” though the pride in him was almost too
great to be restrained.</p>

<p>It had served him better, indeed, if he had put away
his hesitancy. For he was now in the region where all
men knew Mandu, and he might have saved himself a
weary walk. At the end of six days’ journeying,
about the full-moon day of the Sravana month (March),
he came to the southern boundary of the Vindhyas, and,
through an opening on the slope, looked out over the
Dekkhan. It was the first time in eleven years that he
had seen the plain; and there was joy in the sight,—but
anxiety also. For where was Mandu, high Mandu,
“that stands on the edge of the plain”? Had he
come too far to the west, or was he yet too near the
rising sun? Fortunately, a little below him, on the
hillside above the flat land, he perceived a town, whither
he directed his steps, and there, because it was become
a necessity, asked his way. He was answered, readily,
that Mandu was still a day’s journey to the east; and
he was furthermore given directions so minute, that,
pausing only to eat a piece of bread and drink some
goat’s milk offered by a hospitable peasant, he started
again that same night, under the light of the radiant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
moon. Again he took his way up into the hills, following
the course laid out for him, until, about dawn, he
found a well-kept roadway such as he had not before
seen in the Vindhyas. And now, his uncertainty banished
at last, he lay down beside the road, in the shadow
of a pipal tree, to sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, it was noon. For a little while he
lay still, puzzled and thinking, for he had slept heavily.
Suddenly it rushed upon him, the great sense of finality.
And, with a prayer in his heart, he rose up, and
took the road, starting southward at a rapid pace.
The way wound round and down, through a rocky gorge
which he had a vague sense of having passed through
before. Then it began to re-ascend, and Oman’s excitement
grew. He felt that he was nearing the climax
of his life. It was just this that he had unconsciously
waited for through the years. And now it had come!
At the top of the eminence the veiling trees suddenly
parted, and, in the flooding light of afternoon, he found
himself looking along the stone-built causeway that
Rai-Khizar-Pál, returning from triumphant war in the
north, had crossed, with his captives, thirty-one years
before.</p>

<p>Faint, quick-breathing, Oman halted, leaning on
his staff, to gaze upon the scene. It appeared to him
most natural, most right, that, at this moment, with
its familiar little whirring sound, a slender-winged
gray bird should come hovering up from the wood and
seek shelter in his breast. With the advent of this
companion creature, his vision was doubled. Twice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
before had he known this road. There had been a
bride of Dhár, and a captive from Delhi. The feelings
of both were mingled in him:—bitter pain, veiled joy,
curiosity, hope, weariness. He saw the bright pageants
pass slowly before him; and then, leisurely, he moved
downward to the bridge.</p>

<p>All was exactly as it had been, thirty years before.
From the watch-towers the soldiers looked out and up
into the hills, taking no notice of the solitary, toil-worn
mendicant who passed toward the plateau. If they
perceived the bird in his bosom, they only thought him
some dealer in magic who had trained the creature to
be his oracle. Nor, indeed, did Oman notice them.
They were part of the whole scene, but not to be
singled out. His eyes rested on the fields that stretched
along beside two roads that wound, one to the right,
the other to the left, along the plateau. Which of the
roads to choose, he scarcely knew. Memory did not
serve. The fields, already planted, were empty; and he
bethought himself that it was the time of the Sravana
ceremony, when all the people would be in the town,
sacrificing and celebrating in temple and bazaar. At a
venture, he turned to the left, and walked for some
time past fertile rice-fields, and through a patch of
woodland; and all the while, as he went, his heart was
full to bursting, and his eyes were bright with tears.
For he had come home—home. This land was home.
He knew the feel of it. The very air was familiar to
his cheek. The little sounds of animal and bird life
were as the sounds of childhood heard again after many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
years. A great restfulness pervaded him. The tears
that were in his eyes fell, slowly. Then his heart
swelled with a mighty prayer of joy and thanksgiving.
His way had been very long, very dark and dreary; but
it was traversed now. His struggle and his loneliness
were over. Behind him lay the wilderness, and all
about him was the promised land.</p>

<small>A BROTHER OF THE SOUL</small></h3>
</div>


<p>Thirty years had passed over Mandu since that
strange time of death, when, in a single day and
night, a Rajah, his minister, his Ranee, and his favorite
slave had perished, each in his own way. During those
thirty years Bhavani, the only son of Rai-Khizar-Pál,
had been nominal ruler of Mandu. A boy of eleven
at the time of his father’s death, he had of his own
will placed himself and Mandu under the guardianship
of Manava, a minister grown old in service, who
acted as regent till, on his twentieth birthday, the
young man took the cares of government upon his
own shoulders. So well did Manava acquit himself
during the nine years of his regency, that, at the
end of that time, had he chosen to take the throne
from Bhavani and install himself thereon, Mandu
would willingly have hailed him Rajah. But if Manava
had been capable of such an act, he would not have
been the ruler he proved himself to be; and he had his
reward for faithful labor in seeing, before he died,
his young charge come to be called “beloved” by
his people.</p>

<p>Bhavani, indeed, spite of many evil influences that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
surrounded his youth, had grown into a beautiful manhood.
From some unknown source he had gained that
kind of spirituality that is not inherited, and yet is
scarcely to be acquired. His father before him had
been high judge of his people. Bhavani was their
friend. If Rai-Khizar-Pál had been absolutely just,
Bhavani was more than that: he was charitable. The
old Rajah had been most of all a warrior, loving the
sound of battle, first for himself, and afterward for
the glory it would bring his people. Bhavani hated
war, because it carried with it death; and for death he
cherished a horror of which he never spoke. It had
been born in the moment when, stealthily following
Kasya and Churi in their dread morning’s search, he
had looked on the body of Ragunáth, stiff and bloody,
under the champaks near the water-palace, where he had
himself left the Lady Ahalya the evening before. No
one had ever got Bhavani to tell what he knew of
the happenings of that night. In the beginning, he did
not himself understand the part he had played in the
tragedy; but the horror of it was rooted deep in his
secret soul. And, little by little, as he came to manhood,
he began to realize something of the drama
that had been played before his childlike innocence;
though, with strange perversity, his interpretation did
injustice to the slave. And the memory of the two
he had loved, Ahalya and Fidá, became embittered;
for he endured for them all the shame that they had
never known themselves.</p>

<p>The influence of this dreadful incident of his childhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
had had an incalculable effect on his character.
To it Mandu owed the fastidiousness of this beloved
ruler. There was but one misdeed in the calendar of
crime toward which Bhavani was immovably severe.
By him adulterers were punished to the fullest extent
of the law. Nor had he ever been known to consider
an extenuating circumstance. He was himself
a man of the most rigid chastity; and, though he conformed
so much to custom as to marry while still very
young, he had but one wife, attended by women only.
And, there being no zenana in his palace, he employed
no eunuchs elsewhere.</p>

<p>These things considered, one strange act of his
extreme youth must also be recorded. When, after
three or four days of expectancy and dread, the bodies
of those two who had drowned themselves together were
washed ashore, by Narmáda waters, many miles to the
west, Manava, following the old Hindoo superstition,
prepared to burn the body of the Ranee there on the
shore, and to erect over her a fitting tomb, where, on
the anniversary of her death, a sacrifice might take
place for the salvation of her soul. Young Bhavani,
then under the close supervision of instructors, heard, in
some way, of this plan of the regent, went to him in
the council hall, and commanded, by the blood of his
father that flowed in his veins, that the body of Fidá
should be burned with that of Ahalya, and their
ashes buried together. Manava heard him in shocked
silence; and then explained that a Ranee might not
be so dishonored. Useless objection. Bhavani insisted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
And, after a time, he won his way. Thus, now, for
thirty years, the two had slept in a little stone temple,
by the bank of the river which still chanted in their
dead ears its plashing song.</p>

<p>Since the death of Rai-Khizar there had been no
war in Mandu. After the battle on the plain of Dhár,
in which, in spite of the fall of one of the Indian
leaders, the Mohammedans had sustained a heavy defeat,
the invaders had not again penetrated so far into
Malwa. They were still within their northern strongholds;
and the Dekkhan, hearing naught of the crossing
of the Gunga, nor of Agra, nor Benares, the merciless
conquest of the holy of holies, went its way placidly,
catching not so much as an echo of the far-ringing warcry
of the men of Yemen with their Prophet’s sword.
The relations between Dhár and Mandu, always of the
friendliest, had been further cemented by the marriage
of Bhavani with a daughter of the neighboring province.
But, happily for Bhavani’s views, the brother state had
no enemy against whom Mandu was supposed to take
part.</p>

<p>The years passed in peace and well-doing until the
Rajah attained his five and thirtieth year. Then came
an event which, for a long time, seemed to have turned
the severely upright ruler quite out of his course, and
to have made him a man of men, erring and weak. From
some distant land, none knew where, there came to
Mandu one of those purely Indian characters, known long
before the time of the great Buddha: a religious courtesan,
a woman of supreme beauty and magnetic power,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
by name Zenaide. How, by what means, she got her
first audience of Bhavani, no one knew. But within
a month after that, she was installed in the long empty
water-palace, where she dwelt as a queen among men,
or, as men whispered, the Queen of a King. That
whisper was an ugly one, but it found ear for a long
time. Bhavani, immovable by wiles, impervious to
temptation, adamant against force, seemed voluntarily
to have fallen to this woman; and it was not till after
his death that his people perceived how their Rajah,
unconquered by her, had been her conqueror, ruling her
beauty and her will by the inviolable purity of his mind.
But, at the time when Oman came to Mandu, in the
Rajah’s forty-second year, no one understood what were
the relations between the mistress of the beautiful little
palace, and the King of the great building near by.
They were much together. Zenaide, indeed, was with
no one else. How, then, should men not wonder, and
watch, and whisper together?</p>

<p>It was March, and the half-dead world had been undergoing
its annual rejuvenescence. In the late afternoon,
when the shadows are long, and bird-calls are beginning
again, Bhavani, the day’s state at an end, went walking
slowly down the open garden that bordered the road
between the two palaces, and finally halted at the stone
parapet built along the edge of the plateau. Two slaves
followed the King, but halted at a respectful distance as
he paused, gazing down over the green plain and its shining
river. After a few seconds he noticed that another
than he stood near by, also leaning upon the parapet:—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
a man, tall and gaunt, clad in a much-worn garment, his
head and feet bare. Something about the figure drew
Bhavani’s attention, and, looking farther, he suddenly
caught the man’s eyes—great, limpid eyes, laden with
the sorrow of the world. A significant look passed between
the two. Oman had also swept the figure before
him, upward, from the embroidered shoes, over the rich
dress, to the face, finely chiselled, but cast in a mould of
melancholy. There he who had won purity through
the flames of hell, gazed upon him to whom birth had
given all good, and who had taken upon his slender
shoulders some of the burden of the world. In the
first instant of the meeting eyes, each found kinship in
the other.</p>

<p>Bhavani moved a little toward the stranger, and
asked, in a suppressed voice:</p>

<p>“Thou art newly come to Mandu?”</p>

<p>“I crossed the causeway two days since.”</p>

<p>“Whence art thou come?”</p>

<p>“Out of the hills.”</p>

<p>“And whither—art thou going?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, Lord Rajah.”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest me!”</p>

<p>“Thou—art Bhavani,” muttered Oman, softly, to
himself.</p>

<p>The Rajah recoiled a step or two, gazing at Oman
earnestly. Then he asked, in a new voice: “<i>Who art
thou?</i>”</p>

<p>Oman had now recovered himself enough to reply
to Bhavani’s question literally. “I am called Oman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
Ramasarman. I was born a Brahman.—I have been a
Bhikkhu, and a hermit, dwelling in the hills, whence I
descended to Mandu.”</p>

<p>For a moment, Bhavani’s expression was puzzled.
Then he shook himself, slightly, woke from his dream,
and observed: “Thou lookest younger than I. What
is thine age?”</p>

<p>Oman shook his head. “My lord, I do not know.
When I went up to dwell on the Silver Peak, my age
was nineteen years. But how long I lived there—fifteen,
twenty years, perhaps,—I cannot say. It is a
lifetime, and yet again it seems to me as if I had not
lived there at all: as if I had only known a great vision,
that has faded away.”</p>

<p>“Thou wast young, very young, to go up into the
hills alone. And, from thy face, it was indeed many
years before thou camest down. Then tell me, Oman:
was that solitude very terrible to endure?”</p>

<p>Oman’s eyes grew vague. It was as if he looked into
the infinite as he replied: “Yes, it was terrible. I am
told that not many can live as did I, in utter solitude,
and, at the end of five years, still retain reason and
speech. The Chelahs that go up into the fastnesses, for
prayer and the study of sacred manuscripts, go two
together, and, by companionship, preserve their minds.
But I had no companion. I was outcast of men.”</p>

<p>“Outcast! Thou? A Brahman?”</p>

<p>“Outcast! Of what do ye speak?” came a woman’s
voice, from behind them.</p>

<p>Both men turned, instantly; and Oman drew in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
breath. Before him stood the most beautiful woman
that he had ever dreamed of. She was tall and voluptuously
built; and her coloring was radiant. According
to the privilege of her class, she wore no veil over
her face; and as a covering for her heavy, red-gold hair,
she had only an openwork cap of turquoise-studded gold,
bordered with a broad band of the polished stones. Her
dress was of blue, heavily embroidered; and a wide sash,
of palest willow-green, spread smoothly over her hips,
and was clasped low in front with a turquoise crescent.</p>

<p>The two gazed at her in involuntary, silent admiration;
and she bore the look easily, as one accustomed
to it. Presently, however, Bhavani returned to himself,
and addressed her:</p>

<p>“Thou art well come, Zenaide. Behold, here is
Oman Ramasarman, a sage, who has come out of the
hill fastnesses, to dwell in Mandu.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to Oman, he added: “This is the Lady
Zenaide, most beautiful, most wise: my friend.”</p>

<p>Oman looked at her again, and made his salutation.
It was not necessary that he should be told her estate:—that
she belonged to the only educated class of women
in India. And, in spite of himself, the sight of her
gave him a strong feeling of mingled pleasure and of
pain, that had in it a further reminiscence of this land.
There had been a time when looks like hers had been
for him.—But how?—and where?</p>

<p>If the two men were preoccupied, Bhavani with
Oman, Oman with his own thoughts, not so Zenaide.
She was in the lightest of her moods, and she talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
rapidly, her musical voice sounding like running water
in Oman’s ears, as she addressed now one, now the
other, now neither or both of them. To the wanderer,
she had added the crowning touch to the scene:—the
long, shadowy valley, far below, over which the crimson
dusk was stealing; and, behind them, the delicate
structure of the water-palace, its clear outlines softened
by high-climbing vines and great clumps of
feathery tamarind and bamboo. It was the land of
enchanted dreams, and with him were its King and
Queen:—this royal man with the quiet eyes, and the
superb woman, crowned with her glory of hair—the
henna-dyed locks that Oman had never seen before.
But the hour passed like a breath. He remembered
little of her careless talk; but he listened with intense
interest when she fell into a discussion with Bhavani.
She had been speaking lightly of the beauty of the
evening, when, suddenly, without any reason, she
made an abrupt transition to a matter in which the
Rajah was deeply interested.</p>

<p>“My lord, I have been thinking all day of the
matter of Lona, the woman, and her child; and it is
my wish that thou send the child to me. He shall
become one of my household. Because he was taught
theft from his infancy, shall he be punished for it?
Let the woman meet what fate my lord wills. But send
the boy to me. Is not this a solution of thy trouble?”
and she smiled upon the King.</p>

<p>“It is well thought, Zenaide. I will send him to
thee. And yet the woman troubles me more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span></p>

<p>“And wherefore? Did she not sin knowingly?
Disobeyed she not the law?” answered Zenaide, with
a little shrug of indifference that was almost scorn.</p>

<p>Bhavani’s expression grew sad. “She sinned, but
she knew also that her suffering could only be saved
by sin. She stole first of all for her child. To her
it meant that they should know hunger and nakedness
no more. She had been brought into the world,
and, in her turn, bore a boy. But the world refused
her sustenance. Had she no right to take it, then?
Listen, sage, to what I say; and tell me which is
right: the woman, or the law? If a creature starve,
and so steals bread from one that does not starve, shall
she receive the ten lashes that the law provides?”</p>

<p>Oman bent his head a little. “Could she not work?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“She is a widow. There is but one vocation open
to her; and that I have forbidden in Mandu.”</p>

<p>“Then is it not the duty of the Lord Rajah to provide
for those whom he has deprived of a means of
livelihood?”</p>

<p>Bhavani flushed, deeply; and Zenaide burst into a
ringing laugh. “My lord, thou art reproved!” she
said, looking at Oman for the first time with interest.</p>

<p>“Yea, I am reproved, and deservedly. Hermit, thou
art wise and just also. Alas! all my life of training
hath never led me to this simple perception of the
truth. But it shall be as thou hast said. Henceforth,
every one that hath been deprived of his means
of livelihood through me, shall by me be provided for.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
This mother and child shall be pardoned, and shall live
together.”</p>

<p>“But have I not said that the boy should enter my
service?” demanded Zenaide, suddenly displeased.</p>

<p>Oman opened his lips to speak, but Bhavani was
before him: “This man, Zenaide, hath shown more
wisdom than either thou or I. Let us acknowledge the
truth of his words without any anger or false pride.
Thus it seems good to me.” He turned a gentle look
on Oman as he spoke; but the woman, her face obstinately
set, turned away and walked to the parapet at
some little distance, and stood leaning upon it, staring
moodily off upon the darkening world. A faint, half-anxious
smile curled Bhavani’s lips; but Oman, who
was far from smiling, felt moved to say:</p>

<p>“Lord Rajah, you do me too much honor. My word
should not be accepted at once against that of the beautiful
woman. Least of mortals am I.”</p>

<p>“Most humble, but most wise!” exclaimed Bhavani.
Then, after an instant, he added: “Fruitful hath been
my walk to-night. Thou shalt be my guest at the
palace, Oman, and later I will come to thee and we will
talk. For I would know much more of this life of thine.”
Then, with a little gesture that put Oman from him, he
went to Zenaide and stood beside her for a moment,
speaking to her; though what he said and whether she
spoke at all, Oman could not tell. Finally Bhavani
drew Oman to him again, and the two moved slowly
away, through the star-spangled dusk, to the palace.</p>

<p>The next half hour was to Oman a dream. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
much of what he felt was memory and how much
revelation, he had no means of knowing; but there
seemed to be no unfamiliar corner in this great building.
They entered the central courtyard, where, as of old,
a fire burned by night. Before them was the open
entrance to the carved and pillared audience hall. To
the left, rose the north wing, with its long corridor and
tiny entrance to the triangular zenana courtyard; and,
on the right, the south wing, with its temple room, official
suites, and barracks. Behind it, Oman knew, without
any doubt, lay the slave-house. Bhavani, guessing nothing
of what his companion was undergoing, presently
left him, with a slave to whom he had given directions
concerning Oman’s lodging and entertainment.</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of tremulous awe at his profound
sensations that Oman followed his guide into
the north wing, down the broad hall, and up the old,
familiar passage, till they halted before what had once
been the apartments of Ragunáth. The doorway was
still heavily curtained. But within, all was changed.
The room that had been an antechamber, was now cut
off from the others of the suite, and was evidently
where Oman was to lodge. The little place was richly
furnished. Around two sides ran a low, broad divan,
many-cushioned. Walls and floor alike were covered
with heavy rugs. Round stands, piles of pillows, a tall
incense burner, a huqua, and a little shrine containing
an image of Vishnu, completed the furniture; and the
whole place, which was windowless, was lighted night
and day by three swinging lamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span></p>

<p>Once in this room, the slave demanded of Oman
whether he had any commands to give; and, receiving a
negative, speedily retired. For some moments Oman
stood quite still, gazing around him, his mind filled with
wonder. He was back in the present now, realizing
that never in his life had he thought to see a room like
this. He had always regarded his childhood as the most
comfortable and luxurious period of his life; and now,
to him coming out of the long years of hardship and
privation when he had looked for no better provision
than a meal of parched grain and a bed of grass in a
cave, this luxury was scarcely to be believed.</p>

<p>After a little, Oman began to move slowly around the
room, feasting his eyes on every passing phase of richness.
And finally, with a hesitation born of timidity,
he ventured to lie down on the divan, resting his head
and shoulders on cushions, and drawing up his knees,
after the universal custom of the Orient. Then, all at
once, a feeling of naturalness came. Luxury was no
longer strange. The glowing lights, the subdued color,
the faint aroma of stale incense, induced ghostlike
dreams of what had been, of things to come. His eyes
were half closed. Languor and drowsiness stole on him.
It was the most delicious hour he had ever known.</p>

<p>After a time, Oman had no idea of how long, a slave
entered, carrying a tray on which was such a meal as
the wanderer had not seen since he left the Vihara of
Truth. Without making the least sound, the white-robed
servitor placed one of the low, round stands beside
the divan, laid the meal thereon, and disappeared for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
moment, to return with a silver basin and ewer, and a
broad, fringed napkin. Oman held his hands over the
bowl. Perfumed water was poured over them. He
dried them on the cloth, and then, with a look, dismissed
the slave. For a few seconds more he lay quiet, hesitating
to eat. Then he turned upon his elbow and began
the lazy meal, not like a hungry man—which he was—but
after the fashion of palace dwellers, who feast five
times a day. When he was satisfied, he lay back again,
and the slave reappeared with sherbet and a jar of wine.
Leaving these on the stand, he removed the remnants of
the meal, and departed again, this time for good.</p>

<p>Oman touched neither the sherbet nor the liquor, but
stretched himself out on the couch, clasped his hands
over his head, and gave himself up to the dreams that
were still haunting him. That he had been in Mandu
before was certain. But how, and where? The tale
that Churi had told upon his death-night, of the slave
prince and the young Ranee, seemed in some way to
have taken root in his heart, until their story and his
own dreams of this place had become inextricably
intertwined. Why were they so close to him? What
vaguest suspicion was fluttering through his mind?
Above all, how came he to be so familiar with the plan
of the palace? Questions—questions—questions!
They crowded upon him till he could no longer think:
till his brain was fairly numb.</p>

<p>Then, gradually, under the influence of the quiet and
solitude, he fell into that stupor of profound meditation
which is natural to the Hindoo only. His head rested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
on the cushions. His knees were drawn up under him.
His eyes burned brilliantly under their half-closed lids.
And his mind, once more under control, wandered
far, through unfathomable space. Time passed. The
hour grew late, and the busy life of the palace was
stilled. Oman heeded nothing, nor remembered what
surrounded him. He had forgotten Mandu, the day,
the woman of gold, the beauty of Bhavani—everything;
and had slipped back into the old freedom of his
days on the Silver Peak. Humankind was infinitely
far from his thoughts. But humankind had not forgotten
him. Suddenly the curtain of his doorway was
thrust aside, and Bhavani came quietly into the room.</p>

<p>The Rajah was not now in royal raiment, but clad
from head to heels in spotless white, the purity of which
seemed a fitting frame for his fine physique and the
spiritual dignity of his face. At sight of the figure on
the divan before him, he paused for a few seconds, and
then spoke, gently:</p>

<p>“Oman Ramasarman, I am come hither—thine
host.”</p>

<p>For a moment, Oman seemed not to have heard.
Then, with an effort, he rose, and stood submissively
before the Rajah, evidently waiting for him to speak
again. This Bhavani did.</p>

<p>“O stranger, I have come to talk with you on the
subject of wisdom; for this is the only time at my disposal
for the pursuit of those things that I have most
at heart. And it is for this reason that I break in on
thy revery. Sit there, then; and I will place myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
thus, that we may look into each other’s eyes. Ah—now
we may talk together freely.”</p>

<p>Obedient to the request, which was really a command,
Oman seated himself, his knees crossed under him; and
Bhavani took his place on a pile of cushions three or
four feet away. There, for a time, they sat, looking at
each other silently. Bhavani had come into the room,
his brain teeming with thoughts and questions; but he
was quick to feel the chill of Oman’s mood. The
wanderer, indeed, was thoroughly disturbed at Bhavani’s
interruption of his meditation; and he showed his
displeasure by a silence that the Rajah found it impossible
to penetrate. After a little while, however, realizing
his ungraciousness, Oman forced himself out of his
stolidity, and said, in a muffled voice:</p>

<p>“My lord hath sought me. What doth he require?”</p>

<p>For a moment Bhavani looked at the immovable face,
and then replied, in a tone the gentleness of which
Oman had never heard equalled: “I have proffered
hospitality to the stranger, and now violate the privilege
of solitude. Let him forgive me!”</p>

<p>“Do not say it! It is the right of the host at any
time to seek the presence of his guest! What wilt thou
of me, O King? Speak, and what I have is thine.”</p>

<p>A faint smile shone for a moment in Bhavani’s eyes,
but was instantly succeeded by an expression of deep
thoughtfulness: “There is much, stranger, that thou
canst give me, who am a beggar of minds. Thou
saidst that thou wast come out of the hills. What
wealth hast brought with thee from them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>

<p>“What wealth—of thought?”</p>

<p>“Yea, of thought.”</p>

<p>“Ah, much, great Rajah. Much. There, in the vast
wilderness, is peace. I ascended the height toil-worn,
weary of the world, outcast of men. And in the great
Silence was a balm for every wound. Peace I obtained,
and strength, and calm. And after a while came Truth
also. Creeds and philosophies of men I had studied
in my youth, in temple and Vihara. But it was there,
on the height, that my soul found itself, and gave me a
belief that had not come before.”</p>

<p>“Tell me of this belief.”</p>

<p>“It is a system, long and complex.”</p>

<p>“There is time. The night is young. Tell me, I
beg of thee,—Oman.”</p>

<p>Oman looked at Bhavani thoughtfully, and wondered.
For many months he had preached his creed to men, in
the market-place, and it had seemed good to him, and
high, and true. Yet now he was confronted by a ruler
of men:—a King, one who exercised over him a peculiar
fascination. Perhaps he felt a desire to open himself
entirely to this melodious-voiced Rajah; and yet,
on the other hand, a new sense urged him to prudence,
to silence, to secrecy in that which intimately concerned
himself. After a little he asked, almost humbly: “Tell
me then, noble One, why thou seekest of me my—faith?”</p>

<p>“For many years it has been my delight and my desire
to learn all that I can of the many forms of Truth
that live in the minds of the thoughtful. I have also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
a son, nearing manhood, for whom I have founded a
school here in my palace, which has been taught by very
learned men. This school I overlook myself; and I
have been accustomed to search among every class of
men for new thought that can be laid before the noble
youths of my kingdom. For them, and for myself, I
ask thee to expound to me thy creed.”</p>

<p>“And likewise for Zenaide, the woman of red gold?”
demanded Oman, with a flash in his eye.</p>

<p>But Bhavani did not wince. “For her also, who is
my sacred charge.”</p>

<p>“Hear, then, O Rajah, the Dharma that came to me
in the wilderness:</p>

<p>“In space are, and from the beginning have been,
two elements: one, that which we call spirit; the other,
matter. And spirit, which lives and feels and does not
change, struggles constantly after knowledge. In the
beginning, Spirit entered matter and ruled it, and out
of chaos brought form, and conceived and organized the
laws of Nature. But, having entered matter, Spirit
found itself encumbered and bound about by the inert
substance that is foreign to it; and it learned also that
its great Unity had been broken into various particles,
each of which was now enclosed in a form. And thereupon
perceiving itself caught by the encumbering mass,
it set itself to dominate matter, and so to rule it that in
time the fetters should disappear. But this was, and
still is, difficult. Matter is subject to change and to
decay. Moreover, it is the exact opposite of that which
has taken possession of it. And the spirit in the clay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
finds itself ever and again freed and ever and again
seized anew and enclosed in another form, until, after
infinite experience, certain units of spirit found themselves
actually dominant over the evil element, and free
to pursue their natural vocation of perfect power and
stainless happiness. And these, uniting together to give
what aid they might to their still unconquering brethren,
are the only God: that which we should all pray to
for strength.</p>

<p>“We, Bhavani, are spirits still encompassed by matter;
and we struggle from life to life, from form to
form, still hoping, still aspiring, still achieving, still
advancing a little along the road to victory over the
evil element, till, in the end, we shall come into a state
of perfect dominion over our enemy.</p>

<p>“This is the Dharma that I have found in the wilderness.”</p>

<p>“And it is good. Yes, it is good. Yet thy creed is
pitiless, O sage. Tell me: what of those that yield
their lives to matter, that give themselves up wholly to
the evil influence? Is there no punishment for them?”</p>

<p>“Those that travel backward along their road must,
with double pain and suffering, retrace their steps.
That is their punishment.”</p>

<p>“But there is no Kutashala Máli—no place of everlasting
punishment?”</p>

<p>“How can there be? Spirit is good. Spirit cannot
die. And the only power in matter is its inertia. Who
is there to decree such a place as that?”</p>

<p>“Listen, Oman, while I tell thee the story of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
that I knew and loved in my childhood, who sinned
together past forgiveness. Thou shalt tell me if they
yet strive toward happiness; whether they do not still
walk, helpless and despairing, along the Sinners’ Road.
For of such sin as theirs, thou surely canst know
naught.</p>

<p>“My father had a wife, the fairest and the youngest
in his zenana, brought from Dhár, but of Persian blood,
so that her skin was pale, like the lotos petal. She was
called Ahalya; and every one that saw her, loved her.
She had been a bride for two years when my father
brought hither, out of the north, a noble captive of the
invading race:—by name, Fidá el-Asra. And my
father favored him greatly, and came in time to value
him above all his other slaves. And at last he was made
my master, my guardian in my father’s absence. By
some means that I do not know, this slave once saw
Ahalya, the lady of my father’s heart; and, like all
men, he loved her. Then, because he was young and a
captive, she loved him also, through pity. And here he
dwelt, for many months, deceiving the King who had so
trusted him. More than this, Ahalya, like all women,
weak, also gave herself up to wickedness. Thus these
two loved until they sinned themselves even unto
death. For they died together, at last, by drowning
in the Narmáda stream, after the slave had murdered
one of my father’s counsellors, who, I believe, died in
defending the honor of his King. Now tell me, Oman,
if thou canst, what these two found waiting for them
beyond the river of death?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p>“They found,” answered Oman, slowly and distinctly,
“a life of the deepest woe, a constant suffering,
a shame that they can never escape. For those
two, unlawfully joined in one life, are, in the next,
inseparably united. Their two miserable souls inhabit
but one body, in which they have struggled vainly for
release. And,” here Oman rose and lifted his face,
straining upward as if the words he spoke were received
from some invisible source, “and thus they shall
exist till they have drunk the cup of retribution to the
very dregs. But, in the end, they shall escape their
bondage. In time they will complete the expiation and
know the blessed end:—freedom from travail and from
woe. For they will regain their right to move forward
alone, on the road to the Great Release.”</p>

<p>With the last words, he sank back upon the divan,
and a silence followed. Bhavani sat amazed at the
absolute conviction with which this man had spoken;
and he was again seized with strange wonders and
suspicions concerning the stranger’s identity. After a
long pause the Rajah, groping for his words, asked,
hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Wilt thou remain here in my kingdom and in my
palace, master, and lay the foundation of thy faith in
the heart of my son?”</p>

<p>For answer, Oman solemnly bowed his head. He
knew it to be written that he should remain in Mandu.</p>

<small>THE ANCIENT FLAME</small></h3>
</div>


<p>So Oman took up his abode in the palace; nor were
the circumstances of his settling there very surprising
to himself. From the first it had seemed as if, in the
natural course of things, this should become his home;
and the new duties and new habits of life were acquired
mechanically. His intuition of the link that bound
him to the past, however, though at times it was strong
on him, proved evanescent; so that there were weeks
when he lived wholly in the passing hour, without any
memories of bygone days. But he knew that Fate had
been kind to him. He was wrapped in impenetrable
serenity: the outcome, the reward, of his years of solitude;
and he felt that no mischance could disturb this
again.</p>

<p>On the first morning after his arrival, the Rajah himself
introduced him to the palace school, held in that
room which, in the old Rajah’s day, had been a theatre:—the
place where the slave Fidá had first looked upon
poppy-crowned Ahalya. Whatever its former glories,
this room, on the morning that Oman first beheld it,
presented a pleasanter picture. Save for a great rug
upon the floor, and the teacher’s cushion on a daïs at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
one end of the room, the place was quite unfurnished.
On the floor sat an orderly company of young men,
between the ages of fifteen and twenty: all of them clad
in white, with scarlet sashes around their waists, and red
shoes on their otherwise bare feet. These youths were
engaged in a variety of occupations: some of them
studying manuscripts of various kinds, many simply
sitting in meditation, still others indulging, rather
surreptitiously, in games. Among them, without any
distinction as to dress or position, was Bhavani’s son,
Viradha, the heir of Mandu: a pleasant-faced youth,
but not remarkable for any special wit or wisdom; for
he had inherited the disposition of his grandfather, and
was fonder of the chase and the table than of reflection
on the doctrine of atoms<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or the working of the primordial
soul.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> The foundation of the Nyaya system, originated by Kanada.</p>

</div>

<p>Up to to-day, the palace school had been conducted on
a very irregular plan, Bhavani bringing various men of
wisdom or holiness to lecture one or two days a week,
the rest of the time being occupied with indiscriminate
reading from philosophic or poetical manuscripts.
On this day, as soon as the youths had assembled,
Bhavani and Oman made their appearance together.
The Rajah offered a few words of introduction and
explanation: setting forth the fact that at last they were
to have a permanent master, who would reduce their
hours of study to some sort of system and order. During
his speech, every eye in the room was fixed upon
Oman’s tall, gaunt figure, clad in white garments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
his serene face, with its deep-set eyes, and his broad,
lined brow, on each side of which fell masses of thick,
black hair. At the end of the introduction Oman came
forward a little and the young men advanced to him,
and, one by one, kissed his hand. Then they returned,
expectantly, to their places; and Bhavani, able to spare
no more time from matters of state, hurried away,
leaving Oman to his new task.</p>

<p>It was the most difficult morning that Oman had ever
spent. He had had no preparation for his situation, no
time to arrange a course of work. Hitherto he had
preached in small towns, to mere handfuls of uneducated
men and women. Now he stood before a critical
assembly of young noblemen, all of whom had had considerable
instruction in abstract thinking and reasoning:
far more, no doubt, than he himself had ever known.
That he impressed them all, immediately, as a man of
dignity and wisdom, of wide knowledge of men and
high purity of mind, was again probably due to his
years of miracle-working solitude.</p>

<p>To his own keen satisfaction, Oman felt that he had
begun well with his school; and he determined, in his
heart, that the end should be better still. For a month
or more, then, he was invisible to every one save his
pupils. He found that a full and detailed exposition of
his creed to thinking and sometimes sceptical men,
demanded a new labor of thought, a new working out of
little things that had hitherto been mere suggestions in
his own mind; the rejection of some ideas that proved
themselves impossible; and the admission of others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
that he had not hitherto acknowledged. This work,
while difficult, gave him the keenest delight; for the
breadth and fulness of his logic was coming home to
him; and he perceived that this creation of his brain
was no puny shadow, but a thing finely formed, capable
of proper development. He, the seeker after Truth,
had found it; and from the heights was bringing it to
men. It was its own greatest reward.</p>

<p>At the end of six weeks, his labors began to be less
exacting. He had reduced his own thinking to a
system; and he now began to introduce other studies
than philosophy into this school, where arithmetic of the
simplest kind, and writing in any living language, were
considered not as necessaries but as arts. Oman found
time now to see something of the palace and of its
Rajah, who eagerly sought his society. A few days
wrought great changes in his quiet existence; and
presently an incident, entirely unexpected, brought him
a revelation which, for some time to come, eclipsed
every other interest in his mind.</p>

<p>During the six weeks of close work, the circumstances
attendant on his first meeting with Bhavani had slipped
from Oman’s mind. He no longer thought of the scene
by the parapet behind the water-palace, or of Zenaide,
the woman with wonderful hair. But now, in mid-May,
she was recalled to him. One noon, as he sat in his
room meditating through the hot hours, a slave-boy
broke in upon him and delivered to him a message to
the effect that the lady Zenaide desired the presence of
Oman the sage, that she might hear the creed he taught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<p>Oman, taken by surprise, had an impulse to refuse
the request. A moment’s reflection, however, changed
his mind. She had asked for his creed. Believing as
he did, he had no right to refuse her the knowledge.
Besides, was she not under the special protection of
Bhavani? Bhavani was his patron, nay, his friend.
Whom Bhavani loved, Oman would not deny. So he
sent an answer by the little slave that he would come
that day; and the child departed, leaving him in chaos.</p>

<p>Oman spent the next two hours in the greatest confusion
of mind. Never in his life had he been brought
into contact with such a woman as he knew this one to
be:—such a woman as the great Indian romances love
to concern themselves with. He thought of the incident
of the Buddha’s entertainment by the woman of
Vesali, the beloved of Ajuta-Satra, and of her conversion
to the faith. Had the Sakyamuni found danger
in her presence? Was her hair of golden red? And
then, suddenly, Oman started up, resolutely turning his
mind to other things. Hurriedly he bathed and clothed
himself in a fresh gown of white linen, girt himself with
a broad, yellow sash, and wound a white turban around
his head. Then, without pause, he set out for the
water-palace.</p>

<p>The afternoon was late, and the shadows lay long
and golden across the road. Full summer was already
on the land, and Mandu was a riot of verdure. Oman’s
mood responded easily to the scene. Under the spell of
the surrounding beauty, his thoughts grew lighter, till,
when he paused before the open doors of the waterpalace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
he no longer looked like an ascetic. The sombre
fires in his eyes had brightened, and his face was softened
with a smile.</p>

<p>In the curtained doorway stood a tall slave, clad in
rich livery, who addressed Oman with an air of profound
respect, and at once made way for him to pass
within. Oman found himself following the slave
across a broad, square hall, in the centre of which was a
marble tank filled with clear water; and thence they
proceeded to the end of a short corridor, where, before
another curtained doorway, Oman was left alone.</p>

<p>After a moment’s hesitation he lifted the curtain,
and crossed the threshold. He was facing a long, narrow
room, stone-paved, lighted from the top, the walls
hung with embroidered silks of delicate hues. There
was an air of unusual lightness and airiness about the
whole place; and Oman’s eyes wandered for some
seconds before he perceived that, at the far end of the
room, in front of a long, amber-colored divan, half hidden
by a screen, stood Zenaide. Oman uttered a short
exclamation, and started forward, observing, as he approached
her, that there was no smile on her lips. His
eyes estimated her again; and they found much that was
new. She was clad to-day in a long garment of silvery
green, that showed her more slender than he had thought.
She was also paler. Her hair was woven into a crown
upon her head, but was without ornament; and in her
dark eyes there was no expression of the voluptuary.
Oman found himself newly puzzled as he seated himself,
at her bidding, on the divan, while she sank upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
a low pile of cushions on the floor. They had not yet
spoken when a slave entered, with a tray of sherbets
and sweetmeats which Oman refused, and Zenaide, not
pressing him, herself waved away. When they were
alone again, she rose, impulsively, ran down the room,
and lowered a double hanging before the door. Then
she turned, slowly, facing Oman, who was watching
her. For some moments she neither advanced nor spoke.
Oman perceived that she was in a state of repressed
agitation, for her fingers twined and intertwined, and
her clinging garments betrayed a nervous quivering of
her body. It seemed as if it were impossible for her to
speak; yet, as Oman did not help her, she had, perforce,
to make a beginning. She had examined him
minutely, face and figure, before she exclaimed,
abruptly:</p>

<p>“Art thou indeed as learned as they tell me, O
sage?”</p>

<p>Oman’s expression changed. “Not in thy lore,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“My lore? And what is that?”</p>

<p>“Art thou not a woman? Thy lore is love.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” The expression escaped involuntarily. It
was a betrayal.</p>

<p>“Ah!” echoed Oman. “It was for that you sent for
me! Know, then, that I am not a faquir, not a mag—”</p>

<p>“No, no!” Reading the scorn in his tone, she came
forward swiftly and sank down in the cushions at his
feet. “Think not that of me. I know something of thy
creed. Bhavani has expounded it to me. I have considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
it, carefully. But it is very pitiless. Thinkest
thou not it is pitiless to the weak? Wouldst thou leave
no sweetness in life?” Her eyes lifted themselves to
him searchingly, and he felt the spell of her magnetism.</p>

<p>Shaking himself free from the impression, he looked
down upon her with a quizzical calmness that disconcerted
her. “What wouldst thou of me, Zenaide?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Again, overcome by her nervousness, she rose and
began to pace up and down before him. “Nothing.—Nothing,”
she answered; but her words did not indicate
a pause. For a moment or two she walked, but finally
faced him, frankly. “Is love—true love—so ignoble,
then?”</p>

<p>Oman, taken aback, did not immediately answer.
Then, many memories overcoming him, he cried out
painfully: “Unless it be lawful, yes. Surely yes!”</p>

<p>“Lawful! Love hath no law save itself.”</p>

<p>Oman’s lip curled. “Doubtless thou knowest more
of it than I. Wherein am I to help thee? Hast thou
left this love of thine? Return, then, to the land where
he dwells.”</p>

<p>Zenaide listened, and a far-away look came into her
eyes. She was standing now with her back against a
stone pillar, and, as she began to speak, Oman felt himself
gradually fascinated by the perfection of her beauty
and by the abandon of her manner, which, in the beginning,
had been held in restraint, but grew more and
more impassioned as, carried out of herself by her own
emotion, she forgot everything but her theme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span></p>

<p>“The land of my love—lies here, Oman. I came
out of the east, seeking love, journeying through broad
countries. To many I brought happiness, but I found it
never for myself. Then came I to Mandu. And here,
in a breath, I knew that it awaited me. My soul was
lighted as by a torch; and I am still consumed by its
increasing flame. I love. And him I love rejects me.
I, the priestess of love, am unloved! Am I so ugly?—so
old?—so young?—so ignorant? Am I surpassed by
another? I, Zenaide, consumed with fire and tears,
pour out all my wealth on him, and he knows it not.
Daily he looks on my face, hears my voice, reads mine
eyes, and still I am not known. Oh, my beloved—adorable—transcendent—Bhavani—”</p>

<p>She stopped short. Her passion had carried her
beyond herself. She had more than betrayed, she had
proclaimed, her secret. But now, suddenly brought
back to consequences, all her force died, and she stood
trembling, fearful, before Oman, whose face was stern
and angry. There was silence for a long, pulsating
moment, while Zenaide realized that the teacher of men
had become her judge. Oman, indeed, felt his anger
growing within him, and presently gave it voice:</p>

<p>“Hast thou dared to defile the purest of men with
thy love? Hast thou known him, lived near him for
more than two years, seen all the strength of his white
soul, and still dreamed he could so dishonor himself
and thee? Shame to thee! Thou hast, moreover,
sullied him in the eyes of his people; for many say
what is false, that he yielded long ago to thine eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
and thy red-dyed hair. He has housed thee like a
queen. He has paid thee greater honor than if, indeed,
he loved thee. Shame, then, woman, for thy thoughts!
Shame to thee!—What—thou weepest!”</p>

<p>For Zenaide, sinking slowly to her knees, bent her
head upon her hands, and Oman saw two or three
bright tears run through her fingers and fall to the
floor. Her frame was shaken and convulsed with ill-restrained
sobs. After gazing at her for a moment,
Oman, unable to judge of the sincerity of her pose,
went on more quietly:</p>

<p>“Thou hast confessed to love the ruler of his people,
a man standing in the eyes of men for all that is upright—more
than upright. And now thou callest upon
me, his servant, a lover of truth, to condone thy sin.
How couldst thou think thus of me?”</p>

<p>“No—no! Listen! Not to condone—” she lifted
her head, and he perceived that her face was stained
and distorted with real grief. “Not to condone. I sent
for thee because, despairing—” she gave a little convulsive
sob—“despairing of bringing his love to me,
I long to cure myself of the malady. Thou art wise. I
wish to learn wisdom of thee. Thou art good. So
I also would be. Bha—Bhavani has sought to teach
me wisdom, to teach me strength. But I—could never
learn but love from him. O stern—O wise one—cast
me not away! Help me, and I will honor thee all
my days!”</p>

<p>Her pleading was eloquent because it was sincere.
Her voice was not smooth. The words were forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
out like sobs; and in them Oman read the struggle
she had endured before she sent for him. Her
abandon showed this, indeed; for, had he not been
her final hope, she would never have laid her soul
bare before him in her stress. And seeing all these
things, his anger was softened, and he was moved to
some sort of feeling, less pity than sympathy. Kneeling
beside her as she still crouched upon the floor, he
soothed her a little, and raised her up, and led her,
unresisting, to the divan, where he caused her to sit
down. Then, himself taking her former place upon the
cushions, he began to talk. His voice was low and
smooth, and flowed along monotonously. At first he
cared not so much what he said, as that his manner should
quiet her. In this he succeeded. And when he saw
her, forgetful of her tears, sit up and lean forward, listening
to him, he took up a text on which he had never
spoken before—on which he had scarcely permitted
himself to meditate, yet concerning which all knowledge
seemed to be stored away in his heart and brain.
It was the ceaseless, rebellious yearning of woman for
man, of man for woman: that insistent, unreasoning
desire that has caused chaos in the world. Of himself
and his own abnormal struggles, he did not speak. But
it was from them that he drew his words:—the words
that Zenaide knew to be expressive of universal truth.
For some time Oman talked broadly on this theme;
and then, waiving generalities, he continued:</p>

<p>“And it is thus that you have suffered in your soul,
desiring for a companion the noblest of men. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
because you would match your heart with such as him,
so you must become his equal, worthy of him. Let his
own nobility illumine you. It is unlawful, in the light
of the higher law, that you two should love. Show
yourself his peer, then, in quenching this desire, and,
dwelling near his brain, seek not to unlock the chamber
of his heart. Let it not be said that, through you,
his high nature has been weakened and defiled.</p>

<p>“Nay—speak not yet. I see it in your eyes—how
cold my words are to you; how hard. It is true that I
feel within me no fire burning. I know little of that
restless pain. But, hearing many speak of it, I believe
in it; and yet, above, see plainly the great Dharma
shining. Receive, then, the truth. Be not defeated in
your struggle. Go your way knowing that the blessing
of Brahma is upon you for your keeping of the
law.”</p>

<p>“But, in the end, what reward shall there be for this,
my sacrifice? What in the wide world could repay
me for the delight of one hour—of one moment, in the
strength of his arms?”</p>

<p>“The reward is great:—greater, indeed, than any
that receive it not can fathom. It comes in the earthly
Nirvâna, the high, conscious strength, the calm, the
tranquillity, that permeates the soul as water permeates
and renews a parched and dying plant. With this
peace comes the death of yearning and desire. The
pursuits of man and the objects of his struggles—love,
power, wealth, fame—these are little to those that feel
their futility. And I assert this not as the Dharma, nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
as what has been told me; but I speak of what I know.
For, Zenaide, that same reward is mine. Many years
I labored for it, fighting such battles as you could
scarcely understand. But in the end it came;—the
great Relief; and, knowing that at last I should be safe
to dwell among men, I returned to them, and shall remain
among them till my death. The reward is always
with me. It cannot leave me now.”</p>

<p>“But—” Zenaide sat studying him, his seamed
face, his deep-set eyes, his black hair, shaded here and
there with a thread of white; and when she spoke,
there was a pathetic childishness in her tone: “But
thou art old. Thou hast seen life. Desire dies out of
the hearts of the aged.”</p>

<p>Oman shook his head. “I am not an old man. I
was not twenty years old when I went up into the
mountains. I dwelt there for many years; but still I
am not more than five and thirty. I am younger than
Bhavani,” he added, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>To this the woman made no reply. Oman had expended
all his comfort; and now he sat waiting for her
to speak again. She remained quiet, however, her chin
resting on her clasped hands, her elbows on her knees,
her face thrust a little forward. Her brow was contracted,
and she seemed to be thinking, deeply. Her
cheeks bore the marks of tears. Her hair and dress
were disarranged. But she was oblivious of her appearance.
Oman sat studying her, and did not realize how
long the silence had lasted when, without changing her
attitude, she said slowly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span></p>

<p>“It is a creed for men, only for men, that you preach,
O sage. It is cold. It is hard. It is relentless. What
need have I of tranquillity and calm? I am a woman of
red blood. Preach you to me resistance of the emotions?
Think you that bloodlessness, quietude, loneliness
seem beautiful to me?—Ah, yes—it is true! It
is true! He is like that, and I wish to be like him. I
will be like him, Oman Ramasarman! I will, I will—dost
hear? I will!”</p>

<p>“What is it that thou wilt, Zenaide?”</p>

<p>Oman and the woman sprang to their feet, as
Bhavani walked quietly into the room.</p>

<p>“My lord!” cried Zenaide, faintly; and Oman
went hastily forward, with an irrelevant remark which
Bhavani answered, wondering. While this was in
progress, Zenaide’s hands were busy with her hair,
with her face, with her dress; and presently she
approached, mistress of herself again, so quiet, so
self-contained, that Oman could only marvel at her
power.</p>

<p>Bhavani did not stay long, nor would he permit
Oman to depart before him, however much Zenaide
wished it. He seated himself beside the woman, and
talked with her about one or two personal matters;
while Oman, standing apart, covertly watched the two.
He tried hard to discover in Zenaide some sign of the
feeling she had so lately displayed. But, search as he
would, he could find nothing in her bearing that remotely
suggested her true state. If she was always
thus with Bhavani, there was surely little to fear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
From her the hermit’s eyes moved to the Rajah. He
was talking as he would have talked to a man whose
friendship he valued. Seeing them both thus, Oman
took heart. Surely an unlawful emotion could not be
very strong in either heart.</p>

<p>It was after sunset when Bhavani rose to go; and
he and Oman took leave together, Zenaide begging
Oman, in an undertone, to come again to her that she
might talk with him further. Oman promised readily;
and then, arm in arm, he and the Rajah set out into
the starry half-light. As they left the water-palace
behind them, there fell on both an unexpected silence:—such
a silence as, coming from the mind and will
of one, is not to be broken by his companion. It
settled over Oman oppressively; for where Bhavani
was concerned, he was quick to feel the slightest
change in mood. Encompassed by uneasiness, they
moved on in the evening light, and Oman perceived
that Bhavani’s steps lagged. It was as if he loitered
to get courage to speak. Oman had a sense that some
revelation was pending; but instinct told him that he
might not question, might not make the slightest
advance toward confidence. They proceeded till they
were within a few yards of the palace, and Oman
began to think his feeling a mistake, when suddenly
Bhavani halted, and, turning to his companion till,
even in the dim light, Oman could see how drawn and
pale was his face, he said, in a muffled voice:</p>

<p>“Zenaide sent for thee to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span></p>

<p>“And wherefore? Wherefore? What did she want
of thee?”</p>

<p>For the shadow of an instant Oman hesitated. Then
he answered, quietly: “She had heard that I taught a
new creed. She desired to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” The words shot from Bhavani’s
lips.</p>

<p>“That is all,” was the tranquil rejoinder.</p>

<p>Bhavani found no reply to this, yet he did not move
on. Oman stood waiting, with fear in his heart. He
heard Bhavani say, in a voice that was monotonous
with repression: “She had been weeping. I could see
it. She had wept.” Then, all at once, he flung both
arms over his head, and cried out, in a voice deep with
long-endured anguish: “How long, O Brahma! How
long? My strength fails me at last. I can endure it
no more. I shall fall—I shall fall!”</p>

<p>“Wherefore?” murmured Oman, at his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Can you not see? Do you not perceive?” whispered
Bhavani, hoarsely. “I love her. I love her,
Oman. I love Zenaide.”</p>

<p>Then Oman began to laugh. He laughed till
Bhavani, seizing him by the shoulder, shook him like
a rat, crying to him the while to speak. And Oman
obeyed him, saying, in a tone of bitter mockery:
“Thou lovest her, Bhavani, thou, Rajah of Mandu!
Thou lovest her whose heart has been given in turn
to half a hundred; who loves thee to-day for thy gold,
who will love me to-morrow for my creed: <i>Thou</i>, son
of Rajahs, stoop to <i>such</i>?” And again he laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span></p>

<p>Bhavani straightened up, and his face grew hard
and set. “Ah, thou speakest well. It is folly indeed
to talk to thee of love. But have no fear. I am
Bhavani, a prince, the son of princes. I have not
stooped, nor shall I.”</p>

<p>With that speech his expression was not pleasant to
look upon. But Oman felt a sudden relief. He had
won a battle in behalf of the law. Yet, a few moments
later, as he shut himself into his room, he felt a new
confusion and a new bitterness in his heart; and he
repeated over and over to himself these words: “And
these—and these—the greatest and the best, know
still the struggle, still faint before it, still call on high
for the Reason that never comes. Was it so wonderful
that I—we—failed?”</p>

<small>THE RIVER TEMPLE</small></h3>
</div>


<p>The events of that afternoon, which formed the unpremeditated
climax of two years of restraint on the
part of both man and woman, threatened consequences
that did not actually come. For some time after
Oman’s bitter reproach, Bhavani did not go at all to the
water-palace. And Mandu wondered and rejoiced. But
to Zenaide, these weeks were the most terrible she had
ever known. It was probably Oman who kept her
from suicide; for, little as Oman could understand her
or her passion, she seemed to cling to him, and to him
only, in her stress. He felt himself both cowardly and
hypocritical when she moaned to him of Bhavani’s
sudden hatred of her; but he nevertheless held to his
tenets as her one possible safeguard. At times, indeed,
when he could see clearly, he felt that these two creatures
had been given into his hands; that it was for
him to keep them both from a relationship which
would, in the end, shatter them morally and mentally.
With Zenaide he dealt tenderly, for she showed herself
to him in lights of unselfishness unsuspected by any one
else. But he never concealed from her the fact that
he would himself exert all his power to keep her true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
feelings from becoming known to the Rajah. And the
woman after a time accepted, miserably, his view, and
acquiesced in all that he told her about the necessity
of constant struggle, constant watchfulness, constant
self-restraint.</p>

<p>After some weeks it came about that Bhavani
recovered his strength and went again to the water-palace,
where, by degrees, the old relations were resumed.
For this was possible, in that neither of the
two entertained any suspicion of the other’s feeling.
In these new days Oman was, by common desire, much
with them. And nothing, probably, could have made
the lonely creature happier than this. With these two
people he found entire satisfaction. The two sides of
his nature got sustenance; and he experienced for the
first time the delights of true companionship:—a full
and complete companionship, such as few normal people
have the happiness to find. From the first it was plain
that there was little danger of betrayal between the
man and the woman. Oman watched their self-possession,
wondering. Zenaide was no less steady, no less
impenetrable, than the Rajah. Not a look, not a gesture,
not a tone, ever conveyed to Bhavani her feeling
for him. And Oman began to believe that she was
really conquering her nature. The three spent many
hours in the discussion of problems political, judicial, or
philosophical; and, their minds being in harmony each
with the others, these periods became the fullest in their
lives.</p>

<p>To Oman, especially, had come the deep joy of unbreakable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
tranquillity. His life was flowing smoothly,
in chosen ways. He had the assurance that his living
was not in vain; and he knew also that he had succeeded
in conquering himself. Bhavani, loving and
honoring him, would have loaded him with gorgeousness.
But Oman’s sense of fitness did not desert him.
He had no desire to go unkempt; but he accepted only
the state that a lower official of the royal house was
entitled to hold. Gifts of precious metals or gems he
refused. But, early in his coming to Mandu, he took
the Asra ruby from its concealing box, and caused it to
be set in a thin, golden chain which, henceforth, he wore
about his neck; till it became known to all the plateau
as his badge. The story of how it had come to him—from
a mendicant who had died in his cave—he told,
readily enough, to Bhavani. But anything further, the
mendicant’s name, or the strange powers possessed by
the stone, he kept to himself. The matter of reawakened
memory, indeed, had come, little by little, to be
a constant part of the secret understanding that was
always with him. He knew that it had been decreed
that he should learn something of the vast scheme of
life and progress; but he knew also that this inner
knowledge must not be taught to men.</p>

<p>Months passed quietly away. Summer came, with
furious rains; and then the hot autumn, when the
nights were cooled by winds from the hills. The late
monsoon followed, and the fields were green as with
spring. Mountain torrents plunged from the heights
and over the plain to join the turbulent Narmáda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
stream. And winter was there again:—the mild, sunny
winter of the upper Dekkhan, the winter of flowers, the
winter of Eden. Great riches brought these seasons to
the man who had come, a year before, out of the hills to
Mandu. He was known now to every soul in the plateau;
and he viewed his adopted land with enchanted eyes.
He knew places and parts of Mandu that were not
known to men born on its soil. Often he walked alone
through the still palace, living amid scenes of the long
past, seeing in silent rooms faces of those long since
consigned to crematory flames. There were days when
memory was on him overpoweringly: when Rai-Khizar-Pál
and Ragunáth walked abroad through the corridors
and assembly halls; when the Ranee Ahalya, attended
by Neila, sat at her embroidery in the tiny room, dreaming
of him who was to come to her by night; when
Fidá, the slave, watched near the zenana door, waiting,
with trembling limbs, for the hour when he might seek
his love. These times of vision laid hold of Oman like
dreams that are not to be shaken off. But he pursued
his way quietly, in the face of the double life decreed
for him by his distorted Fates.</p>

<p>The winter passed. Spring stole upon the land, and
grew, and proclaimed herself again, and got joyous welcome
from all the earth. And it was only now, when
he had been a year in Mandu, that Oman learned of
a strange custom of the new rule. Down upon the
shore of the Narmáda, five miles west of Mandu, at
the spot where, thirty-three years before, the bodies of
the Ranee Ahalya and Fidá had been washed ashore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
close locked in each other’s arms, there had been raised a
little stone temple, whither, once in two years, on the anniversary
of the death, the Rajah of Mandu, his officers,
and the Brahmans repaired to serve the high gods for
the souls of the sinful twain. This custom, inaugurated
during the regency of Manava, had been continued
through his reign by Bhavani, in whom the act was
the one sign of countenance granted toward any one
guilty of the degrading sin. The alternating anniversaries
of the quadruple death were given to mourning
services at the magnificent tomb of Rai-Khizar in the
palace temple. And the incongruity of the two acts
was much whispered about, but never mentioned before
the Rajah.</p>

<p>It was the year of the river pageant, for which preparations
were begun a week or more before the fourth
of April. On the morning of that day, the whole
palace was astir by dawn; and, in the early light, a large
company set out on foot to descend from the plateau;
for horses could only await them in the plain, below.
Oman found that the descent was easy enough, for,
directly behind the palace, where the slope was less
steep than anywhere else, a long flight of steps had been
cut in the rock, and the plain could be reached thereby
in less than half an hour. Oman and Bhavani started
first and were on level ground in advance of the rest of
the party. There, at the base of the plateau, they found
horses and donkeys assembled, all yellow-caparisoned,
and wearing high funeral plumes in their crests. Presently
there was a general mounting: priests, lords, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
officials, according to their rank, ranged two and two
on their steeds; and after them, on foot, a number of
villagers and country-folk, for whom the day was a
holiday. In the first hour of sunrise the cavalcade was
set in motion and began to wind across the plain to
the river bank:—a long, slow-moving line of pinkish
yellow, that saddest of Indian colors.</p>

<p>To Oman, the sensation of riding was novel enough,
and far from unpleasant. Everything—the sweet, early
morning air, the silvery mist on the plain, the rushing
river-song, the rolling hills in the distance, and the grave-eyed,
silent man beside him, all worked themselves into
his mood, deepening the impression of the hour. By
nine o’clock the little temple was in sight. When it
first appeared, a dim, bluish blot in the flat distance, the
heart of Oman rose within him. His face grew very
white. On his breast the Asra ruby burned, and the
light of it, shining blood-red in the sunlight, or the fact
that he had gazed too long at the temple, or perhaps
some still more natural cause, made him suddenly dizzy
and faint. In the whirl of his feeling, he looked
toward Bhavani beside him. The Rajah sat stiffly in
his saddle, his yellow turban throwing into pale relief
his stern, set face and deeply glowing eyes. He gazed
unwinkingly forward, and Oman’s look followed his.</p>

<p>Directly in front of them it lay now,—a small, square
building of grayish white stone cut in heavy blocks.
The top of the structure was flat and square, but from
the middle of it rose a conical, pagoda-like dome, also
of stone:—to the Indian eye a sufficiently symmetrical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
finish to the whole. The entire building was ornamented
with innumerable bas-reliefs, flutings, and carvings,
crude enough in themselves, but, taken in the
mass, giving an effect of considerable richness. Neither
wing, veranda, nor jut marred the straight lines of the
side walls; and for this, the temple was probably unique
in the jumbling architecture of its period. As it stood
here, silent, deserted, on the edge of the wild-rushing
stream, surrounded by shadowy plain and backed by
high-reaching hills, it gave an impression of loneliness
that no momentary spectacle of trooping horses and
men could shake off.</p>

<p>It was some time before ten o’clock when the procession
halted and dismounted at its destination. There
was a pause, while the priests opened the long-locked
doors and kindled a fire inside, before the small, stone
image of the god. Then, Bhavani leading the way,
with Oman close behind him, the throng passed into
the stone-lined chamber. Oman entered with closed
eyes. There was an oppression on him that would not
be shaken off. He shook and shivered in the chill of
the little place. When he finally looked about him, the
chant of prayers had begun, and he was surrounded by
silent, motionless men. There were no windows, and
little light entered through the doorway, which was
occupied by villagers who strove to hear something of
the service. The audience, therefore, could see only by
means of the flickering firelight. Everything—roof,
walls, floor, and the image of the god, were of the same
grayish-white stone, polished, but not carved. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
centre of the floor, however, close to where Oman stood,
was the marble tomb that had been built over the
ashes of the two whom they came to mourn. The
whole of this sarcophagus was covered with inscriptions
and carvings gracefully arranged. And this was all
that the temple held. A single glance was enough
to take it in. Oman saw it so; and then he stood
listening dully to the meaningless words of the chant,
while the ruby burned upon his breast, and his brain
throbbed with the pain of memory.</p>

<p>When the prayers were finished, every one left the
temple and went out into the open, where a meal was to
be served. But, while priests and people ate, in separate
groups, Oman and Bhavani, who were of one mind,
returned to the building, and silently reëntered it.
Advancing to the sarcophagus, they paused, one on
either side of it, Oman resting both hands on the chilly
marble. The eyes of the two met, and each found in
the other’s look what lay in his own:—bitterness and
sadness. When they had stood there for a long time,
each wrapped in his own thoughts, Bhavani murmured,
quietly, as if to himself:</p>

<p>“I loved them—both. Ahalya, thou beautiful one,—lying
here,—what hath been thy Fate in death?”</p>

<p>The last words were barely audible; for it required
courage to break the silence of that room. The stillness
of it seemed almost supernatural. It was scarcely
broken by the faint fluttering of a winged creature that
skimmed in through the half-open doorway. Oman
looked up and perceived a slender, gray bird, of peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
shape, hovering under the roof above his head. It
was his companion, he knew at once. Bhavani seemed
not to have noticed the intrusion; and Oman did not
mention it. But the scene was suddenly complete for
him. He felt comforted. And he realized also that here,
some day, he should himself yield up his imprisoned
souls, and in this silent place enter upon his well-earned
rest. Looking into Bhavani’s eyes, he said, quietly:</p>

<p>“Lord Rajah, let thy father’s ashes be some day laid
within this room. Many years have passed since these
two committed their sin against him. To their troubled
souls it would be forgiveness should he, whom they so
wronged in life, come to them in death, and lie beside
them, peacefully.”</p>

<p>So gently did Oman say this, and with such conviction,
that Bhavani could not be shocked by the idea.
After a long, thoughtful silence, he only observed:
“Thinkest thou so, indeed?” And then he relapsed
again into thought. Shortly afterward, without further
speech between them, they passed out of the tomb, closing
the door behind them.</p>

<p>A little later the company rode away from the lonely
place, their faces turned toward Mandu. It was a quieter
journey than that of the morning; for the service in the
temple-tomb had not failed to make its impression on
the most careless. Oman and Bhavani were again side
by side, still silent and thoughtful, gazing into the
cloudy east. When at last they left the river and
struck across the plain, Bhavani, leaning toward his
companion, said, in a muffled voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span></p>

<p>“Thou hast spoken of peace to the twain were my
father laid beside them there by the river. Why,
rather, should not their ashes be carried up into Mandu,
and placed in the palace temple, where their Rajah
lies?”</p>

<p>Oman hesitated for a moment, stroking his horse’s
mane. Then he answered, dreamily: “That is their
place there, by the river. It is a peaceful sleep. They
would not rest well near the palace of their treachery.”</p>

<p>Bhavani bowed his head, and seemed as if about
to reply; but he closed his lips again without having
uttered any word.</p>

<p>Thus ended Oman’s first visit to the tomb: an incident
that brought much into his life. It proved the
beginning of intangible things that carried changes in
their train. There was at first a new relaxation of
mind; for it seemed as if some final touch had been put
upon his own existence. Less than ten miles away was
his own resting-place, waiting his coming. He knew
this intuitively; and it seemed to him that, however
long he should still live, there could be no further
pilgrimage for him. His life at Mandu was not for a
mere Vassa season. He had attained his Arahatship;
and need not any longer dread the privation months
each year.</p>

<p>During the following summer Oman went twice,
alone, to the tomb; each time spending the night there
and returning, next day, on foot. What he did in those
times, or why he went, no one knew. But he had been
given a key to the temple doors, and men might see, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
they wished, that he carried it always in his girdle.
Zenaide once ventured to ask him of the purpose of his
journeys, and he smiled, and answered her:</p>

<p>“I go there to pray to the great Brahma for two erring
souls.”</p>

<p>“The souls of the Ranee and the slave who were
drowned together?”</p>

<p>Oman bent his head.</p>

<p>“And dost thou not think, O Oman, that for such
sinful ones there must be hundreds of reincarnations to
expiate their crimes?”</p>

<p>“Was there happiness enough in their sin to repay a
thousand years of suffering?” he asked, bitterly. “Nay,
woman, I tell thee that thirty years of sorrow and
struggle hath more than paid—more than paid! There
is a strict justice over all things. The Divine Soul alone
knows the real measure of happiness and misery meted
out to each of us. He also knows in how much the
crime carries with it its punishment.”</p>

<p>“Thou art a strange man, Oman,” she answered,
looking at him curiously. “Sometimes I could think
thee mad if thou wast not so—so assured. Whence
come these thoughts of thine? Art thou inspired?”</p>

<p>“Nay, Zenaide. Knowledge must come to all who, by
bitterness and tears, have drawn near the infinite. Suffering
brings much beauty to the soul. I begin to think
that men shun it too much.” And then Oman smiled,
and went away, fearing lest he had spoken too plainly
to one who, through her nature, might understand.</p>

<p>Much to Oman’s surprise, and to the amazement and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
consternation of the whole plateau, Bhavani, after six
months of deliberation, acted upon the impulsive suggestion
made by Oman, in the river temple on the anniversary
of the death of Ahalya and Fidá. In the
autumn of that year the ashes of Rai-Khizar-Pál were
removed from their tomb in the palace, and borne
down the river to a new grave. The act came
very near to causing a general uprising. Bhavani’s
own son pleaded with his father on his knees not to
dishonor the great warrior, his grandfather, and thus
bring infamy upon himself and the whole line. It
was in vain. Oman’s secret idea had taken root in
Bhavani’s heart; and a revolution would not have
turned him from his object. In the month of October,
just before the rains, Rai-Khizar’s ashes were laid beside
those of his dead wife, in a new marble tomb, the magnificence
of which a little consoled the people for the
disrespect to their warrior king.</p>

<p>It was Oman who was charged with the matter of the
reinterment; and, when the priests had finished their
service after the burial, he went down to the river bank,
and at the risk of his life began to talk to the angry
mob that waited there. It was a dramatic scene. In
the beginning his voice was completely drowned by
the roars and cries that rose from the usually passive
and obedient people. Probably only the presence of
Bhavani saved the hermit, as he was called, from personal
violence. But Oman held doggedly to his
place; and, after a time his very appearance, as he stood
upon a block of stone twenty yards from the temple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
silenced the noise, and brought the people, against their
will, to listen to him. As he began to speak, his voice
was like the melodious ripple of a summer stream. He
talked of wrong-doing and the forgiveness of sin; and
the doctrine that he preached had never been heard
in the east at all. One long before, in the west, had
spoken such words; but they had not lived truly in the
hearts of men. Before Oman paused, however, he had
brought all the throng literally to his feet, because of
the things he said and the way he said them. And, in
that hour, Oman won his place with the low castes of
Mandu, among whom, henceforth, he was privileged to
much that their priests could not obtain of them.</p>

<p>By this unpremeditated act, Oman made possible
for himself something that he had desired long and
earnestly. It opened the way for him to go down
among the humbler people, and cause them to reveal
their souls to him, that he might give them his truths.
In the next months he studied, ardently, the nature of
mankind, in the hope of finding means of escape from
temptation for those too weak to resist it, and of giving
proper strength to those who could still struggle against
themselves. But, even while he labored, a new discouragement
came upon him. He succeeded only too well
in probing the natures of those who sought his help.
To him, whose severe and troubled life had been exempt
from the complicated wrong of living, the constant discoveries
made to him of selfishness, pettiness, deceit, of
warped and perverted notions of right and wrong, thrown
before him in all the chaotic tangle of actual existence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
brought revelations that overpowered him with their
barefacedness. All alone he wrestled with problems that
have neither beginning nor end; where, from the first,
all has been so wrong that there is no hope of setting
it right. He saw almost as the Almighty must see:—the
terrible falsity of each individual; and, the reason
for it, the reason for the fact of existence, being withheld
from him, he fainted under the burden of seemingly
irreparable wrong. It was no joy to him to reflect
that, compared with most men, he had lived the life of
a saint. Oblivious of himself since his victory was
won, he tried to take up the battle for others too ill-equipped
for resistance. And thus, after all, Oman
showed himself not very wise; for he had not learned
that, by the first law of creation, man works out his
destiny alone. But this new problem proved to be
also his last turning-point. He had ceased to live for
himself. Henceforth all his desire was for others. It
is the last lesson:—one that men are not often trusted
here to learn.</p>

<p>“LA-ILAHA-IL-LAL-LAHA”</p>


<p>Ten years glided away. Oman was more than forty,
and Bhavani about fifty-five. To the worker among
men the time had seemed longer than that spent
on the Silver Peak. There he had, after a little,
won faith in himself. Here he came gradually to perceive
that he was accomplishing nothing of that which
he had set out to do. Little by little he was made to
realize that those who are wholly of the world can get no
help out of the great, abstract truths: the high standard
of religion. This at last he perceived. But he would
stoop to no creed petty enough to catch the belief of his
people. It was, indeed, only what is discovered by all men
who seek to bring high truths home to narrow minds:—that
the great, polluted religions have, by slow process
of retrograde development, been constituted by the
masses for the masses, who must thenceforth only be
left alone to peck over and over the heap of chaff from
which the last kernels of truth have been long since
snatched away.</p>

<p>Fortunately, during this period of thankless labor,
Oman had not lost touch with a wider world. Bhavani
and Zenaide, the man and the woman, were still his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
refuge. To them he carried some of his weariness, and
from them got constant renewal and refreshment.
Their lives had become tranquil,—singularly so, indeed.
Only Bhavani, as he grew older, sometimes chafed at
the thought that he alone, of all Manduvian rulers,
had been peaceful, had brought no glories of conquest
and plunder home to his people. He fretted lest
Mandu’s prestige had been dimmed by his policy;
though he could not deny that he had trebled the
strength of his kingdom in wealth and in population.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he would sometimes say, “at my death the
country will be fit for Viradha’s rule. He will find
her ready to give him soldiers and gold for his wars.
He will be what my father was. With all thy teachings,
Oman, thou hast never eradicated in him the warrior
spirit.”</p>

<p>And Oman would shake his head, his eyes growing
sad; for he was not a lover of war.</p>

<p>This matter of the long-continued peace in Mandu
was not wholly owing to the policy of its present
Rajah; for, during all the early part of his reign, there
had been quiet in the turbulent north. Now, however,
sinister rumors began to spread and grow. It
was, indeed, a time of universal disquiet; for this was
the middle of the constructive period of Indian history:
the time of the fusion of two great races. Conquest
had begun two hundred years before, under the
great lord of Ghazni. The second conqueror, Mohammed
Ghori, had been dead but forty years. And,
since then, the first line of slave kings, founded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
Aybek, had been broken by another slave:—Balban,
the mighty minister of studious Mahmoud. Under
him began the first concerted campaigns into Gujerat
and Malwa, which were eventually to result in the
conquest of everything north of the Dekkhan. In
Delhi, now the capital of Moslem India, there dwelt
more than one powerful general of the Prophet’s faith.
Among these, Osman-ibn-Omar, the Asra, had won high
reputation for the courage and daring that were, indeed,
characteristic of his race. In his youth he had known
Lahore, even mountain-built Ghazni; and now, his
father long ago honorably dead in battle, the son,
himself more than sixty years old, dwelt in Delhi,
yearning for new wars. And it was eventually he, still
bearing in mind an old, disastrous campaign of Dhár in
the Vindhyas, who now, in the year 1249, swore to his
lord a mighty oath that in him Malwa should find its
conqueror. He would go down to the south, and learn
whether a cousin of his, whilom head of the Asra race,
were still, by any chance, alive and in captivity among
the unconquered natives. But of this matter the folk
of Mandu, peacefully engaged in the garnering of rice
and millet, knew nothing, and as little cared.</p>

<p>Oman, perhaps, had some premonition of what was
about to come. At any rate, during this winter, his
spirit was restless. He had recourse to many long-abandoned
methods of tranquillizing himself. He felt
that he was becoming world-troubled. The still waters
of his nature had been disturbed and set into motion
by a too intimate knowledge of various matters. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
all his efforts after calm brought him but temporary
relief.</p>

<p>Part of his trouble lay in the sad knowledge of
Bhavani’s state. The beloved of Mandu was afflicted
with a mortal disease, slow in its fatal progress, but so
sure that no man knew of a single prayer, a single sacrifice,
that could prove efficacious. Zenaide and Oman,
much depending on each other, did not scruple to speak
of the inevitable: the shadow of death that hovered daily
over them. Zenaide grew strong, now. It was that
strength of despair that upholds us at the last. Even
Oman, knowing, as he did, her inmost heart, marvelled
sometimes at the calm that possessed her. She was no
longer young; but, unlike most of her race and class,
middle age had not made her ugly. She had lived too
well for that. Beauty of spirit, gathered during her
years of painful youth, the time of her sacrifice, brought
its reward, clothing her with a dignity and a serene
beauty that mere happiness cannot give. Bhavani’s wife
was dead: had died as she had lived, among her embroideries
and her trivialities, regretting to the last the
zenana life in which she had been brought up. Bhavani,
always reverent toward her in life, felt no acute sorrow
at her decease, and, after her burial, returned to his
usual way of life, affecting nothing. There were still
those in Mandu who wondered if he would not take to
wife the woman to whom he had been far more devoted
than ever he was to the daughter of Dhár. But Bhavani
never entertained a thought of marrying her who had
been the greatest courtesan in Malwa. Nor did Zenaide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
herself regard marriage as a possibility. Youth had
passed both from her and from him who, all unknown
to her, had passionately loved her. The fire of youth,
quenched in its height, had found another life, had been
transmuted into a deep and holy affection that demanded
no closer bond than that of friendship. If the thought
of marriage ever came to the woman, it was only with
the wish that, in the suffering he endured almost
constantly, she might comfort him as only women can.
But Bhavani preferred to die as he had lived: austerely
and alone. If he was aware how closely his people
watched him, he gave no sign. Oman sometimes wondered
if the Rajah dreamed of the storm that his marriage
with Zenaide would have raised among the people. Only
Oman, from his constant intercourse with the lower
classes, knew how blindly and how bitterly the woman
of the water-palace was still hated. But Oman himself,
had the two chosen to unite themselves, would have
uttered not one word of remonstrance:—would, indeed,
have given his life in their defence. So had time
changed his earlier, rigid views.</p>

<p>It was in this year 1249 that Viradha-Pál, the young
prince, began to take his place in the government
of Mandu as a person of importance. Indeed it was
time that he came into his own. Bhavani had kept him
too long in the background. Mandu was beginning
to whisper that he should have been at war for them
these five years past: that it behoved a Kshatriya to
follow his profession. And Viradha, allowed liberty of
action, proved himself worthy of his people by quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
claiming his own. Bhavani let him go; for he knew
that the spirit of the old warrior kings was upon the
youth; and he knew also, still better, that the time
approached when a warrior would be sorely needed in
Mandu. For Bhavani, in his peacefulness, was by
no means blind to the outlook of India; and it was
no surprise when Viradha came to him with tales of
Mohammedan invasions in the north, and demands of
an army with which to march against the alien race.
Bhavani acceded to his demands, making, however,
one stipulation. Viradha must marry. <i>Then</i> he might
leave his wife and go forth to battle. Such was the
rule in the Orient.</p>

<p>Thus it came about, after all, that there were marriage
feasts that year in Mandu. A princess was
brought from Mandaleshwar, on the north bank of the
Narmáda, far to the east. And there was a great
Brahman sacrifice, and the usual three days of ceremonial.
The deserted zenana was opened once more,
and a new woman installed there in her loneliness.
One week her husband tarried by her side. Then he
took his man’s privilege, and left her alone in her state,
while he marched away at the head of his little army—fifteen
hundred men—into the echoing north. The
benedictions and the adoration of all Mandu followed
him. Old Bhavani had been a good ruler, the kindest,
the most just of men. But, after all, men were made
for war, and it was better that the princes of men should
be generals than judges. Alas for Mandu! Rejoicing in
its newly raised standards, shouting itself hoarse with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
its own battle-cries, deaf to presentiment, to rumor, to
the prophecies of the gods, what wonder that it heard
nothing of that faintly-echoing cry that was ringing
out over all the plains and heights of India? The cry
that had risen out of the black Kaaba of far Mecca, and
now rolled, in one continuous shout, from western Granada
to Benares, the holy city, transcending speech by
its sharp fanaticism, finding by force a home in every
land: “<i>La-ilaha-il-lal-laha!</i>” This was the cry that
Viradha had gone forth to oppose. It was the same cry
to which Viradha’s grandfather had answered with his
death.</p>

<p>The young prince went away in the middle of the
Ashtaka month (December). His going made no
change in Mandu, save that it gave the people an added
interest outside their monotonous lives. The pleasant
winter passed slowly away. Bhavani had begun to depend
much on his appointed teacher of men; and Oman
left his unheeded labors among the lowly in order to
watch over his dearly loved lord. Bhavani was sad;
missed his son; suffered keenly, but did not complain.
Oman himself never suspected how much that royal
soul endured, silently. But, as the days passed, he
became more and more aware of a changing aspect in
many things. There was in him a sense of foreboding,
a feeling of finality, indefinable, omnipresent. Zenaide
also felt it, and her melancholy became unconquerable.
She knew what the outer senses could not tell her; and
even Oman’s quietly proffered sympathy was repelled.
Bhavani doubtless guessed all that passed in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
minds; but he could not take their burden from
them. He knew himself to be too near the end. He
could only spare them anxiety by the silent endurance
of pain.</p>

<p>The end came sooner than even he, perhaps, had
expected. It was in February, about the middle of the
month; and early thrills of spring hung in the air. On
the eighteenth day, at noon, Oman, who was in his own
room after a long morning in the school, was roused
by Bhavani’s favorite slave and conducted swiftly
through the palace to Bhavani’s bedroom. Bhavani was
on his couch; and Oman, who had not seen him since
the previous evening, at once knew everything. The
room was in confusion. Evidently many people—doctors,
priests, slaves—had been there recently.
Why they were now gone, Oman could not surmise.
Bhavani lay breathing in long, heavy gasps, with intervals
of startling length. His face wore the gray hue
of death. His eyes were closed; but he felt Oman’s
entrance, for he put out his hand, and Oman took it
and fell upon his knees beside the bed.</p>

<p>“Let me summon help for thee,” he said, in a low,
clear voice that suggested nothing of what he felt.</p>

<p>“No,” gasped the dying one. Then, after an effort,
he added: “I hear Brahma’s voice. Shall I not—answer
it?”</p>

<p>Oman could not speak. He buried his head near the
face of his friend. It seemed to him, at that moment,
that Fate had found a cruelty too great for passive
endurance. For Oman loved this man as he had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
hoped to love in life. It was like tearing his heart
in two to watch that inevitable, resistless advance of
death. Yet, with the heroism that was in him, he accepted
Bhavani’s own decree: feeling, indeed, that
there was no human help for his King.</p>

<p>Moments passed:—an hour:—and still Oman knelt
by the bed. Suddenly it seemed as if the Rajah’s
breath was coming a little more easily, a little less
terribly. Quickly he lifted his head, and looked.
There was a change. Bhavani looked older, grayer,
more shrunken. But his eyes were half unclosed, and
he seemed to be in less pain. While Oman gazed,
unable to speak, scarcely to think, a shadowy smile
crossed the Rajah’s lips, and he began to murmur a few
unintelligible words. Oman bent to catch them, and
Bhavani’s eyes rested on his face.</p>

<p>“Fidá,” he whispered, low, but distinctly: “we
played together—with Ahalya—”</p>

<p>“Yes. Yes!” answered Oman, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Brave things. Let us play again. I always Arjuna.
Thou, O Fidá, Yudishthir, the King.—Ahalya, the
beautiful Draupadi. I have won her from all the rest.
But now—we are marching away—from Hastinapur.
We are seeking heaven. It is a long journey. We
reach the sea. Dost thou remember all the places,
Fidá? Agni stops us awhile; and then—we come
into the plain that leads to Himavan. I have read it
many times. See,—they are gone, all of them!
Nakula and Bhima and Draupadi are dead in the
desert. But I go on alone into the hills—and—yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
this time he is there!—Sakra—O God!—I come!—Behold,
I come!”</p>

<p>Smiling, gasping out these words of one of his
childhood’s games, that was, in fact, an epic of the
pilgrimage of life, Bhavani, holy among men, slipped
away out of existence, perhaps ascending in Sakra’s
own chariot, that had so often awaited him in his
young imagination.</p>

<p>Till long after he knew that Bhavani was gone from
him, Oman knelt there, by the bed, gazing blindly on
the still, waxen face. Presently he became aware that
there were others in the room. Slaves crept in and
out, and brought doctors and officials, and those who
were to care for the high dead. Then, dazed and
bowed down with his weight of grief, Oman rose and
passed out, through the palace, between little knots of
whispering men who made way for him and looked
after him, longing but not daring to question. He
left the palace behind and went on to the duty that
was his. The heart in him bled. There were no
thoughts of help or of comfort in his brain; yet he
knew that none but him could tell the woman of their
common woe. So he turned toward the water-palace,
where he was always admitted without delay.</p>

<p>Zenaide was in the wide, central court of her dwelling,
lying on a pile of cushions placed beside the marble
pool. In her hand she held a piece of millet cake,
which she had been crumbling for the fishes in the
water. At Oman’s entrance, however, she rose, and
went to him, hastily. As she looked into his face, Oman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
without speaking, watched her expression change from
gayety to wonder, and so to fear, till he knew that there
was not much to put into words. Now she reached
out both her hands, and Oman took them into his own.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she said, faintly.</p>

<p>“Dost thou not know?” he asked, his voice seeming
to him to come from another world.</p>

<p>“Bhavani,—” she began; but her voice broke.</p>

<p>“There is no longer a Bhavani,” he answered, wondering
at himself for the speech.</p>

<p>She took it quietly, letting his hands drop from hers,
and turning away so that, for some seconds, he could
not see her face. Then she moved nearer him again,
and said, in tones not natural, but still well controlled:
“Come, let us go into a smaller room.”</p>

<p>Oman assented in silence; and she led the way down a
short passage to that apartment in which they had held
their first interview, many years before. And there she
caused him to sit down upon the broad divan, while
she took her place at his knee. Again, in their woe,
their hands met. And then Zenaide, bowing her head,
let tears come. Oman could not weep. His grief was
deeper: far more terrible, indeed, than he had believed
it could be. His own great creed brought him no
comfort.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bhavani was entombed in the temple room of the
palace, in the place whence his father had been lately
removed. The ceremonial of cremation was magnificent;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
but there was one grave lack in it. No willing
women accompanied him into the flames. There were
no blood relatives, no children, to mourn at his bier.
The spectators, who could remember his father’s entombment,
compared with this the wailing concourse
which had assembled about that funeral pyre, on which
lay the body that had been carried all the way back to
Mandu from the disastrous plain of Dhár. Here was
no terrible grief of dying concubines and dust-covered
widows: no deep-throated sobbing of warrior sons. Two
aliens, man and woman, stood together, hand in hand,
beside the frightened little bride of Viradha; and these
were all, beside the people, that mourned Bhavani’s
death. Truly, the royal line of Mandu was fading
away! The long ceremony brought to every heart a
feeling of emptiness, of forlornity, that was not easy to
overcome. The people felt it, and even the Brahmans;
and there were those who covertly wondered if young
Viradha, returning home, would find his own awaiting
him.</p>

<p>Fortunately for himself, Oman had no time, in the
next few weeks, to grieve. Not knowing just how
it came about, he found himself in the position of
regent, all Mandu having voluntarily demanded their
government of him. There being no other hand ready
for the helm, he accepted the place, constituting himself
keeper of Viradha’s state, guardian of his honor, treasurer
of his heritage: holding himself ready at any
moment to deliver all these into the hands of the young
King. He clung closely to Bhavani’s methods, finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
himself little at a loss to fill a place the duties of which,
from constant observation, he had learned so well.</p>

<p>Thus a month passed away. Oman, occupied almost
day and night, saw little of Zenaide, whose burden of
grief was hers to bear alone. Oman, even in his sadness,
had found consolation in an unexpected effect of
his labor of the past ten years. He perceived that what
he had hoped for against hope was true: the people
loved him. Through his years of work among them
they had treated him ill. They had been deaf to his
teachings; they had mocked at his laws; they had reviled
him for heresy to their faith. He had come to believe
that he had brought good to not one soul. And now,
suddenly, upon the accession of a little pomp, they went
to him, sought his counsel, obeyed and loved him more
than they had ever obeyed and loved even Bhavani.
Oman took their devotion for the best that it brought;
and rejoiced that his way was made easy for him.
Now he longed only for the return of Viradha, which
could not be much further delayed. He had gone away
in December. It was now the end of March. Surely
the thought of his young wife must draw the warrior
homeward soon. Nay, Oman had a presentiment that
the course of events would force him back.</p>

<p>Oman was right. Viradha did return, shortly. It
was the last week in March, and the spring was in its
loveliest, early beauty. Was it right that this renewal
of youth, these ever-recurrent love-yearnings of nature,
should be broken by the harsh voices of war, an autumnal
woe of blood and death? Yet this came: so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
swiftly, so overwhelmingly, that there was no time for
consideration or planning. Only action was necessary;
and only action was taken.</p>

<p>The first premonition of disaster came upon the afternoon
of the second day of April, when two or three
wounded and exhausted fugitives reached the haven of
Mandu, bringing the startling news that Viradha and
his little army were close at hand, in full retreat before
a victorious Mohammedan horde, who had pursued them
clear across the mountains. It was a thunderbolt; for
none had ever dreamed that the plateau, defended by
the whole wide range of the Vindhyas, could be in
danger from the conquerors of Delhi. But the word
of the fugitives had to be accepted. Their plight was
unquestionable. Within twenty-four hours Viradha
and his men would be in Mandu, where something, no
man said what, must happen.</p>

<p>Through the night, every soul on the plateau labored
as never before. Even the children were pressed into
service; and Brahman and Sudra worked side by side,
placing barriers along the causeway, which, when the
Manduvians had reached the plateau, could be thrown
across the narrow bridge, and the invaders shut away.
It was the only plan of defence that occurred to Oman as
feasible; and none of those that sat in council with him
could find a better. All was uncertain. They could
only busy themselves as best they could;—and wait.</p>

<p>The waiting was not long. Through the whole of the
morning of the third, fugitive soldiers continued to pour
in from the mountains, bringing word of the valiant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
the desperate bravery of Viradha in his retreat, and of
the overwhelming force of the invaders. Oman sat in the
great audience hall, questioning every soldier that came
in, ordering, thinking, planning, till, about one o’clock
in the afternoon, there came to his ears the sounds of a
great, confused clamor:—the distant battle-din that proclaimed
the arrival of the Rajah and his army.</p>

<p>Then, had any one been there to watch, he might
have thought that the Saint of Mandu had gone suddenly
mad. A spirit of fury had, indeed, rushed upon
Oman. He ran out of the palace into the courtyard,
where, by his command, a horse was waiting for him.
He sprang upon it. All the man, all the one-time Asra
bravery of Fidá, was seething in his blood, beating in his
brain. From a staring slave-boy he seized a shield and
spear, but waited for no armor. Clad in his accustomed
white garments, a white turban on his head, and, for his
one ornament, the great ruby hung about his neck, he
started away, at full gallop, down the road toward the
causeway. As he advanced, the sounds grew nearer:
the noise more hideous. And above it all, from time to
time, like a sentence of doom and death, came the
strange accents of that strangest of all battle-cries:
“<i>La-ilaha-il-lal-laha!</i>” which, twisted, means: “There
is no God but God.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIIb">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THE SIGN OF THE RUBY</small></h3>
</div>


<p>The galloping horse, with its white rider, dashed round
the curve in the road that opened upon the great stone
causeway; and Oman perceived that he was none too
soon. It was upon that narrow bridge that the long,
horrible retreat of the young Rajah of Mandu had
reached its climax. Here he made his last stand against
the invincible Prophet-horde. The scene on the causeway
was indescribable. Oman had one moment’s survey
of it: one moment, during which all his strength, all
the fury of race and loyalty that were in him, rushed
into his two arms, into his brain, into his eyes. Then,
without pause, he was carried down into the writhing,
struggling mass.</p>

<p>The plan of defence prepared over night for Viradha’s
assistance had come to naught. The two armies
had fought their way, hand to hand, all down the rocky
defile that led to the plateau; and they reached the causeway
in an inseparable mass. It had taken the whole
morning for the Moslems to force the defenders from
the entrance of the pass, two miles above, to the bridge.
The men of Mandu, knowing well the consequence
of defeat, had fought as never men fought before; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
now, on the threshold of their homes, they made the
supreme effort. The retreat was over. The fight on
the causeway was the death struggle. When it ended,
there would be no more resistance to the followers of
Mohammed.</p>

<p>Like others on that bridge, Oman too had gone
mad. He did not think, he did not feel. He was
a machine. His horse, trained to war, had plunged
into the very thick of the battle. On every side men
were fighting together: man to man, two to one, three
to one, but always without concerted action, always
as in a series of duels. Of those in the mêlée, Oman
was the only one who wore no armor; and how, during
the first ten minutes, he escaped with his life, it would
be impossible to say. After that, his shield was omnipresent,
his sword all-pervading. Man after man went
down before him. Those of Mandu that saw him,
marvelled. Their Saint had become inspired by a demon.
The Mohammedans regarded him with suspicious
fear. Was this an angel, a Jin, come from heaven to
defend a chosen country? It seemed, for a few minutes,
as if his appearance might turn the tide of battle. But
victory was not for Mandu. Where the war-cry of the
Prophet now rose in India, it was not to be stilled by
any bravery, any heroism. Just now, no one looking at
that close-writhing mass of combatants could have told
which way the fight was going. But there was, for the
Indians, a very <i>sense</i> of defeat, a gradually increasing
fear, born of presentiment. Oman felt it with the rest;
but still he fought, with the fierceness of despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span></p>

<p>Not yet, in the closely packed company, had he
caught a glimpse of the young Rajah. Dealing out
his blows and parries almost mechanically, Oman
found time to wonder in which of the heaps of dead and
dying piled against the high balustrades of the causeway,
the son of Bhavani lay. But presently the horror
of that thought was removed. Just before him, upreared
on a bleeding horse, helmetless, blood-smeared,
worn almost beyond recognition with the work of the
last week, was Viradha, closely beset by a powerful
Moslem, whose rich accoutrements and shining scimitar
proclaimed him of rank. In a kind of maze, Oman
watched the young man parry blow after blow, saw the
terrible weapon finally plunged down with undefensible
stroke, and, in the same instant, waking from his trance,
flung himself forward across the young man’s body and
lifted his face to that of the Mohammedan. There was
a strange shock. The Moslem recoiled from the blow
he had dealt, his eyes fixed in fascination on something
that shone on Oman’s uplifted breast:—the Asra ruby,
blazing in the sun.</p>

<p>Oman recovered himself swiftly, and drew back from
the body beneath him. His attempt had been vain.
Viradha lay supine upon his horse, limp and motionless,
the bright life-blood gushing out of his very heart.
He was dead. Oman knew it before he looked. The
hope of Mandu was gone; and, in the same instant,
the battle was ended. Like one in a dream Oman
heard the din gradually fade into silence, and saw the
great Moslem chief lean over, draw his weapon from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
the young body, and then straighten up and look
about him with a half smile. The Manduvians, those
that remained, had lowered their arms, and were piteously
begging for quarter. But Mohammed spares not
the unfaithful. Oman, perceiving what a hideous,
silent carnage was beginning, felt a new rush of fury,
and hurled himself at the Mohammedan leader, the
slayer of Viradha. At once two other Arabs fell upon
him, from the right and from the left, and Oman surrendered,
as the general gave two or three sharp orders,
and the soldiers, stopping short in their attack, seized
Oman by the arms, lifted him forcibly from the saddle,
and dragged him down till he stood on his feet. Then
they led him back along the causeway to one of the
empty watch-towers. Into this they climbed with him,
bound him fast, hand and foot, with his own sash and
two leathern straps from their accoutrements, and then,
with some words incomprehensible to him, they descended
to the bridge again, leaving him alone. For a
moment his thoughts swam through seas of blood. After
that, the deadly reaction of passion setting in, he mercifully
fainted.</p>

<p>He was unconscious for a long time. When he came
to himself again, there was a singular stillness around
him:—the stillness of many dead, not to be broken by
the faint, indistinguishable sounds of the horde on the
plateau. It was late in the afternoon; for the sunlight
was pouring through an opening in the west wall of
the watch-tower. Oman looked into the yellow light
till he was half blinded. Then he closed his eyes. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
was in great pain; and half of him was numb with lying
for so long in one position. Unknown to himself, he
had, in the battle, received one or two wounds, not
serious, unfelt, indeed, in the excitement, but which
now troubled him severely. This, and the ache of his
arms and ankles where the fetters held him, threw him
into a kind of stupor of pain. He could hear the flies
buzzing over his blood; but he could not think of anything.
Why should he? Everything was gone; and
the mass of fact was too overwhelming to be realized.
His brain, recently overactive, was as weary as his
body. He was aware only of the lengthening afternoon,
his own pain, and his rising thirst.</p>

<p>After a while the sun set, the swift twilight passed,
and the young moon shone in the west, above the dead,
sunset colors. Oman was sleepy. It seemed fitting
that, with night, he should rest. He wondered a little if
he was to die in the watch-tower, forgotten, and raving
for water. To his dulled mind it made little difference,
just now. Wondering, stupidly, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Oman had, however, been by no means forgotten.
Shortly after moonset, which was very early that
night, he was waked by two men—soldiers—who,
penetrating his retreat, undid his bonds by the light of
a torch, and addressed certain sharp words to him in
their unknown tongue. Oman, obeying the instinct of
common sense, rose to his feet, swayed and reeled with
numbness, and was promptly pummelled into sensibility
by one of the men who seemed to understand what he
needed. So, presently, the three of them, Oman with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
soldier on either side, descended the narrow stone steps
of the tower and came out upon the causeway. Here
was a sight to try the nerves of the Mohammedan conqueror
himself. All was deathly still, yet already men
were working by the light of torches, the sickly, flickering
glare of which cast streaks of light and shadow over
the horrid scene. The whole width of the bridge
reeked and steamed with blood; and here and there
separate bodies blocked the central path. Against the
high balustrades, on either hand, were great, inextricable
heaps of slain. At the sight, Oman’s gorge rose;
but, at the same time, there shot into his mind the question:
“Why am I not lying here? What was it that
preserved me from death?” He had seen Osman’s
look; but he could not account for it. He only knew
that quarter had been given him where nobody else was
spared; and, even before this scene of horror, he sighed;
for he had long since been ready to face the Unknown
Beyond.</p>

<p>It was a long walk to the end of the plateau. Oman
wondered a little why the conquerors had made the
palace, instead of the town, their headquarters, never
dreaming that, in six hours, Osman and his army had
swept Mandu from one end to the other, after the
manner of a race long accustomed to conquest. When
the prisoner and his guides passed the water-palace, Oman
gazed sorrowfully upon its dark outline and its empty
door. Where was Zenaide, the Lady of Mandu? Alas!
Who could say? Finally, when the captive was on the
verge of exhaustion, they reached the palace courtyard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
and here, at last, found a scene of life. In the centre of
the court, where so many holy sacrifices had burned to
Agni and the Hindoo Trinity, was an immense bonfire,
at which torn and weary soldiers were cooking food.
Everywhere were men, talking, shouting, laughing in
their barbarous tongue. But nowhere could Oman find
a familiar face. Where were all the slaves that had
been wont to pass and repass through this court by
night and day? Where were the officials? Had they
followed the fate of their defenders? At the thought,
Oman trembled like a woman. However, he and his
guides crossed the square, and entered the audience
hall, where there was a scene indeed.</p>

<p>The place was lighted by a hundred torches and hanging-lamps
that threw a yellow, smoky glare over the
confusion below. An impromptu feast had been prepared
for the general and his officers; and, the wine-cellars
found and rifled, these good Moslems for one
night waived the tenets of their creed and celebrated
the day’s carnage after the Delhi<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> fashion, by drinking
themselves either maudlin or insane. As Oman, in his
blood-stained robes, appeared upon the threshold, Osman,
the great general, not so drunk as his men, was walking
toward the daïs at the head of the room, where stood the
royal throne. Catching sight of the figure in the doorway,
however, the conqueror paused, with one foot on
the step and turned a little toward him. Oman got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
a distinct picture of him there. The leonine head was
bare, and the heavy, whitish hair and beard framed
a face of fierce and vigorous strength. Most of his
armor had been removed; and he was clad in a crimson
robe, heavily embroidered and studded with jewels.
His undertunic was a vivid green; and in his belt was
stuck a dagger, the hilt of which flashed with emeralds
and blood-stones. This was Osman ibn-Omar el-Asra,
head of that perishable race; and he turned, in his hall
of conquest, to meet the deep-eyed gaze of him who
wore the lost charm of the Asra.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> The law against drunkenness was never strictly kept by the
Mohammedans during the conquest of India. The Delhi kings were
notorious for debauchery.</p>

</div>

<p>Lifting his voice above the general clamor, the conqueror
summoned Oman to him. The captive obeyed,
moving slowly forward till he could have touched the
hand of his captor, who still stood gazing at him. Again
their eyes met; and this time, before the penetrating
glance of the hermit, the eyes of the warrior fell. After
an instant, however, they were lifted again, and Osman,
speaking in perfect Hindustanee, said:</p>

<p>“Thou art he whom they called, this afternoon, the
white Demon?”</p>

<p>“I do not know what men called me.”</p>

<p>“Thou wouldst have saved the young Rajah from my
scimitar?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly,” answered Oman, scowling; and the
conqueror laughed.</p>

<p>In a moment, however, he was serious again, and,
dropping all preliminaries, demanded: “That stone—the
ruby that you wear upon your neck—what is it
called? Where found you it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span></p>

<p>A sudden flash of understanding, of more than understanding,
rushed over Oman. Out of the long, long
ago came remembrance of this same man that now stood
before him; and he asked, suddenly, the involuntary
question:</p>

<p>“Art thou Osman ibn-Omar el-Asra?”</p>

<p>“Yes. By the Prophet, how knewest thou I was
ibn-Omar?”</p>

<p>Oman did not answer. He took from his throat the
chain on which hung the great ruby; and, with an indescribable
gesture, he went forward and slipped it over
the head of the Mohammedan. “It is the Asra ruby,”
said he. “It has found its race again. My trust is
finished.”</p>

<p>Then, without another word, he turned and walked
out of the room; nor did any one attempt to stop him.
Osman, confounded, dazed, indeed, by the assurance of
Oman’s act, remained motionless, staring after him.
The two guards who had brought him from the
tower, and had watched the scene with speechless
astonishment, seeing that their lord gave no commands
about his recapture, stepped aside to let him pass. And
the others in the room never noticed him at all.</p>

<p>Heeding nothing of what lay behind, entirely fearless
of the conquerors, Oman left the hall in which Rai-Khizar-Pál,
and Bhavani, and lately he himself, had been
wont to sit in council, crossed the broad courtyard
where the slave Fidá had so often watched, and finally
reached the road, which was silent, and lighted only by
the stars. The palace of Mandu was behind him, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
he had yet one other mission to fulfil. He went on to
the water-palace, which, a little while before, he had beheld,
still with the stillness of death. Was Zenaide
there? Or whither was she gone? He must know.
For she had now only him in the world to look to.</p>

<p>When he came to the door of the building he found,
to his amazement and consternation, that it stood open.
No slave was on guard; but within, near the marble
pool, hung a burning lamp that cast a faint light
round about. Oman halted beneath it, and listened intently
for some sound. There was one:—the softest,
intermittent sighing:—a low cry, like the wailing of a
new-born child. Unhesitatingly Oman followed the
direction from which it came—followed through room
and passage, till he had reached the inner apartments of
Zenaide, and penetrated to the sanctum: her sleeping
chamber. Here he found her.</p>

<p>All that he at first perceived was a long, narrow
room, the walls hung with palest blue, on which were
embroidered white flocks of doves. There were many
tiny lights round about, and against the walls knelt
half a dozen women, wailing and beating their breasts.
Beside these were one or two of the male slaves, standing
about dejectedly, but uttering no sound. This was
Oman’s first glance. Then he perceived something
else, which instantly swallowed up every other thought.
At the far end of the room stood a bier, hung with
blue embroideries; and upon it, quiet, peaceful, still as
a marble figure, lay the priestess of Radha, in her last
sleep. The great eyes were shut. The wonderful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
red-dyed hair was bound smoothly into a high crown
above her brow, and one or two white lotos flowers
were fastened above her ears. Her garments were
all white, her feet encased in white shoes. There
was but one spot of color anywhere. Over her heart,
beneath her left breast, was a stain of moist crimson,
that widened and spread a little, even as Oman gazed.
It told him all that he would have asked. He stood
silent over her, while the women and slaves crept close,
looking up to him with some sign of hope in their
heavy eyes. But, for the first time, perhaps, Oman had
no hope to give. His thoughts, indeed, were not here.
He was thinking of the slow order in which every one
that he had known and loved in his life had passed into
the other land. It was beginning to come home to him
that his own hour of liberation was near. His eyes
travelled slowly over Zenaide’s perfect form, from her
face, which now, in its repose, showed the marks of
time and sorrow, down her white arms, and to her
white-clothed feet. Then, suddenly lifting his hands
over her, he said, softly: “Rest thee, rest thee, in
peace!”</p>

<p>Then he turned to go. But the living ones crowded
about him, demanding what they were to do.</p>

<p>“The invaders cannot forbid the right of burial.
On the morrow let her be burned, and the ashes placed
in an urn. By night let one of ye convey this to the
palace temple and lay it upon the tomb of the Lord
Bhavani. Thus they shall meet in blessed death.”</p>

<p>Then Oman would have gone, but that one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
women, Zenaide’s favorite attendant, ran to him and
laid her hand upon his arm, saying: “And thou, my
lord, whither art thou going?” Her voice sank to a
whisper, for she felt her presumption.</p>

<p>“Whither I go ye know not. Sufficient it is that
ye see me for the last time. I commend your mistress
to your care. Farewell.”</p>

<p>Then Oman, in his stained garments, with the marks
of fetters on his wrists and ankles, left the room of
mourning and passed through the house till he came
again to the central room. Here, the crises of the day
at last ended, his body was overcome with weariness;
and he lay down beside the marble pool, and slept.</p>

<small>SUNSET</small></h3>
</div>


<p>When Oman opened his eyes again, red dawn was
just breaking upon a silent world. Kneeling at the
pool, he performed his ablutions, and then walked to
the open door. How fragrant the morning was! The
air was rich with the perfume of flowers. Even in the
early freshness there was a promise of heat; and drowsy
bird twitterings complained of it. But Oman, standing
quiet in the door of the water-palace, thought not of
nature. He was looking out across still Mandu, the
conquered land; and the heart in him bled and ached.
Yesterday he had fought for his people, his country, his
lord. To-day there remained only the bitterness of
irretrievable defeat. And Oman’s one thought now
was for the people:—the men and women of the fields,
who were left to bend beneath the conqueror’s yoke.
These lowly ones, for whom he had labored so long, he
could help no more. If he went among them to-day,
and listened to their plaints, he should have no comfort
for them, could counsel nothing but that which it were
best for them to learn for themselves:—submission.</p>

<p>Oman, faint from long fasting, leaned his head against
the door, and looked out across the quiet fields. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
thoughts were turned to strange things. He remembered
that it was the fourth day of April:—the day
when Mandu was accustomed to worship at the distant
tombs of Rai-Khizar-Pál, the Woman, and the Slave.
There would be no prayers offered there to-day. What
matter? What mattered anything? To the strange
one, leaning upon the dawn, came a great peace. Perhaps
he slept. Certainly he dreamed; for there passed
before him, in the faint light, a pageant of those whom
he had known. And they called to him, softly, and
welcomed him with greetings. First of all, from out of
the long ago, came Kota, his mother, who looked on
him with tender eyes, as one who had worshipped her
first-born; and, with gentle motions, she beckoned to
him. Next was Hushka, the Bhikkhu, clad in worn,
yellow robes, with a pale nimbus round his head.
There was peace in his shining eyes, and Oman knew
that he no longer dreaded the weary eight months’
pilgrimage. He had won his eternal Arahatship. Then
followed Churi, madness no longer written in his
haggard face. He smiled upon Oman, and called a
greeting, in friendly voice. After him came Bhavani,
looking as in life, an expression of high dignity mingling
with the infinite affection in his face. Behind,
moved young Viradha, with many wounds; and Zenaide,
newly dead, with lilies in her hands. Slowly,
slowly they passed from sight: phantasms, perhaps, of
Oman’s brain. He thought them gone, when, out of
the gray mist, came two more, hand in hand, spirits
interlocked, faint, shadowy, as if they did not live even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
in their ghostly land: a man and a woman. Seeing
them, Oman shuddered violently, and shut his eyes.
When he looked again upon the world, there was nothing
there. He felt only a great warmth in his heart, a
burning eagerness to answer the calling of his dead.
Thus he straightened up, and started forth, looking
neither to the right nor left, in the direction of the
great palace.</p>

<p>His way was lonely. He met no one till he had
passed round the building where the Asra chieftain
lay asleep. Behind the palace sat a little group of
slaves, eating a meal of millet cakes and milk, which
they timidly offered to share with Oman. Oman sat
with them, and broke their bread, and drank of their
simple beverage; then, rising, he offered them a ring
which he wore in memory of Bhavani:—a circlet of plain
gold; all that he had upon him of any value. Wondering,
the simple creatures accepted it, not in payment
for what he had eaten, but because high lords walk
always abroad with gifts for the poor. And, proffering
thanks to Oman and to Vishnu indiscriminately, they
watched the hermit begin his descent of the plateau.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when he stood at last upon the
plain. He had been a long time coming down; for he
had been often obliged to pause and rest. He began to
realize that he was shattered by the struggle of yesterday.
Body and nerves played him false, and the result
of his many years of austere living suddenly threw itself
against him and broke his force. Nevertheless, he
proceeded, walking feebly across the plain toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
river bank, wondering a little how, when he had reached
the river, he was going to finish his journey. None
seeing him would have believed that he could walk five
miles more. Yet that was what he had set out to do.
He wished to go to the river temple, to pray for the
three that were buried there.</p>

<p>His passage across the plain was strangely solitary.
The rich fields, in which stood crops already a foot
high, the young spears calling for water, were deserted.
Here also was the trace of the invader. All the
people of the lowland, quickly getting news of Mandu’s
disaster, had driven together their herds of cattle and
buffalo and retreated with them into the jungle:—a
heedless, sheeplike retreat, that lost them their half-year’s
crops, but could not make encounter with the
soldiers of the Prophet less inevitable.</p>

<p>An hour after noon, weary and faint, tottering, indeed,
as he moved, Oman reached the bank of the
bright-flowing Narmáda. Here he found that his providence
had not deserted him. On the shore, close at
hand, drawn a little up from the swift water, lay one
of the broad, flat-bottomed boats used occasionally by
peasants for ferrying the stream. The guiding-poles
lay in it—a fact that told much. Those that had used
the boat would not use it again, else they had taken
the poles with them. Oman stared at it for a few moments,
uncertainly. Then he waded into the water,
and dragged it, with great effort, after him. When
it was afloat, he threw himself upon it, took one of the
poles, pointed his barge down-stream, and then, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
current took it with a rush, lay down supine, folded his
arms across his breast, and shut his eyes.</p>

<p>The afternoon of the first day of Mohammedan
Mandu was growing late. Yellow shadows lengthened
across the fields. To the south, the flat, alluvial plain
stretched away, dotted now and then with a mud town,
or fringed with the jungle into which, in the India of
that day, all civilization sooner or later resolved itself.
In the north, not very far distant, rose the great rock
of Mandu, crowned with her circle of stone palaces;
and back of that, a silent, threatening horde, stood the
dark Vindhyas, barriers of the Dekkhan.</p>

<p>Of these things Oman saw none. He knew that
they were there, but his eyes were at rest, and the
troubles of life and of conquest had left his heart. He
was floating swiftly into the sunset. His boat, guided
as if by magic, swept on, down the rushing current,
till the tiny, dark blot of the temple-tomb grew, and
took shape, and drew near upon the right bank.
After a time Oman stood up to watch, waiting for
a moment when he could beach the boat beside the
building. But help was not demanded of his hands.
As they neared the destination, the river curved; and
suddenly, driven by some counter-current, the boat
whirled off and ran aground, exactly in front of the
tomb. It was, perhaps, the selfsame twist that had,
more than forty years before, thrown the bodies of the
man and woman up out of their grim refuge. To him
that was waiting to enter the temple, it was a miracle.
He felt that he had chosen a true way; that his act in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
leaving Mandu had been approved by a higher mind
than his.</p>

<p>Now, in the golden afternoon, he stood alone before
the tomb. A vast stillness encompassed him as
he moved forward and unlocked the heavy doors.
There, in the dim mustiness of the long-closed place,
stood the two sarcophagi; and, as always, when he
came alone hither, he had a feeling of intimacy
with the dead. But this sense had never been so
strong as now. He knelt beside the ashes of Ahalya
and Fidá, and prayed to the great Brahm; and, as he
prayed, there arose in his breast an overmastering desire:—the
desire to lay himself down in the shadows of
the little place and sleep. After a time he passed
over to the resting-place of the old Rajah, and dumbly
craved his forgiveness for the wrong done him by his
wife and his slave. Then, finally, he went outside
again, and stood upon the bank of the stream.</p>

<p>Sunset had come. The Narmáda rushed by: a tempestuous
flood of crimson and gold. The world was
alight with fiery glory. It was the sign of the conqueror
in the land. Only the being who stood alone
in his surrounding solitude, the long years of his
expiation and atonement behind him now, could turn
his face fearlessly, without dread, toward that coppery
sky. As he gazed into it, the gray and violet shadows
came stealing out over the splendor. The day was
dying. It was again the prophecy of the India that
should, in time, conquer its conquerors.</p>

<p>With a palpitating heart, Oman gazed about him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
overcome by the strangest emotion. It was as if his
souls were straining at their fetters. Yet still there
was a sense of desolation, a lack of something that was
to come. Darkness was around him. Then suddenly,
out of the west, from the now hidden fires there, it
appeared:—the slender, gray-winged bird, the mysterious
complement of his souls. As of old, straight
to his breast it flew, trembling and warm. Clasping
it close, Oman lifted his head and murmured
softly:</p>

<p>“Lord, it is finished. Let me now go.”</p>

<p>Then he turned, and slowly, very slowly, walked
into the temple. One outside, looking in through the
shadows, might have perceived that he laid himself
down upon the tomb of the two that had sinned of
old; and that the bird upon his breast was still. A
little later, moved, perhaps, by the evening wind, the
doors swung gently to upon the body that had now
delivered up its long-imprisoned souls.</p>

<p>The theme of Mr. Churchill’s new novel is largely the peaceful conquest
of the great Louisiana Territory by American settlers during the years from
the purchase of Louisiana onward. The book’s timeliness is obvious; but
what is more to the point is that the story portrays the immigration of
Americans into the Louisiana Territory, their settlement therein, and the
gradual, sure way in which they brought the empire sold to us by France
under American rule, and implanted in it American social and political
ideas. Mr. Churchill also describes the life of that age in the States bordering
on the east bank of the Mississippi, and the ideals and standards
which actuated the people of those States, and puts into the form of fiction
the whole American spirit of the early years of the nation. This is the
second novel in point of time in the series of novels dealing with American
life which Mr. Churchill is writing. “Richard Carvel,” which dealt with
the Revolutionary War, was the first, and “The Crisis,” which dealt with
the Civil War, was the fourth.</p>

<p>Two delicate and dainty love stories woven into one narrative. The plot
turns on the marvellous resemblance between two step-sisters, the one a
royal princess, the other supposedly the daughter of middle-class people,
but really also a “Daughter of Nijo"—Nijo being a prince of Japan. By
an odd fatality each of the sisters loves the man to whom the other has
been betrothed by the relatives. The sisters meet one another for the first
time, and discover this. The happy inspiration occurs to them to exchange
clothes and places; but they are careful not to inform their respective lovers
until after a good many things have happened. It is a pure romantic
story, alive with genuine charm, and written in excellent English with just
a touch of naïve quaintness.</p>

<p>This new story by Mrs. Kingsley is full of human interest. A rich young
orphan endeavors to find out how working women live. So she goes out

and they begin life together with the joint determination to spend all of
her money in doing good.</p>

<p>The love story of Mary Queen of Scots has always fascinated. Probably
no other woman in the world has been so violently attacked or so stanchly
defended. Wonderful indeed her fascination and charm must have been.
Certainly no one can read the history of her times without realizing that
she exercised over men a sway that has hardly been rivalled by any other
woman since the world began. Three centuries after her death she still
sways men’s minds and hearts. It is the love story of this fascinating
woman which Mr. Hewlett has taken for the foundation of his new novel;
which opens while Mary, a widow of nineteen, is still at the Court of
Catherine de’ Medici, and continues through all the stormy era of her life
in Scotland. The story is vital with interest and alive with action; and
plot, intrigue, and counterplot mingle and cross and move toward the end.
Through it all walks Mary, magnetic, passionately alive, and very human
woman.</p>

<p>This is a piece of gentle, delicate fooling; as the sub-title puts it, “a

it contains real humor.</p>

<p>The same unfailing charm pervades “The Woman Errant” which readers
of “The Garden of a Commuter’s Wife” and “People of the Whirlpool”
will so well remember. Less a garden book than its predecessors,
and more a novel, this new story reveals a growth in power that will delight
the admirers of the author’s preceding work, while it will also attract many
new friends. One of its phases touches on a curious social phenomenon
of the present day, which has become strongly marked, yet which is absolutely
untouched hitherto in fiction—the challenge of the woman domestic
by the woman errant.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
